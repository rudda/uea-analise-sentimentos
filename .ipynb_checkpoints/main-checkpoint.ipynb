      "Wonderful food, place for real shrimp gum.The waiter Éric Lima served us very well, we intend to return as soon as possible.\n",
      "Good food, nice drinks and a very cozy atmosphere.We tried many things and everything pleased us. Especially a duck served in one of the house dishes, sensational!\n",
      "Excellent to go with the family! Great food, pleasant atmosphere, good service and parking. worth knowing\n",
      "I have had ice cream at Visabor for over 30 years. Fruit or artificial flavors. Crunchy cone and simple atmosphere. Very good prices. I recommend\n",
      "The best hamburger I've ever eaten! Excellent service, the food was great. The restaurant is quite small, but nice and fun.\n",
      "The restaurant is new, super cozy and charming with great service. The portions are generous, very tasty and at a fair price. Good selection of wines. I highly recommend the seafood spaghetti, bolognese, carbonara and risotto. The tiramisu is also fantastic.Every time I went with my boyfriend, but it is an excellent environment to take family or friends.\n",
      "We went on a Saturday, elegant atmosphere, kind and friendly staff. We ate a very tasty curry, but the filet was not filet. The dessert (pineapple wonton with pepper jelly and ice cream) was great.\n",
      "Great food with good attendance and with a lot of good things to take your wife and girlfriend and family because the food portions are good!thank you\n",
      "Nice atmosphere, totally affordable price, and I love the menu there! Not to mention the wonderful service! I will always come back 😘\n",
      "The pizzeria is the most traditional in Belo Horizonte. There are several options. In addition to the pizzas there is also an exceptional parmeggiana, delicious and juicy\n",
      "I was with my family this afternoon for the first time I came across a beautiful and cozy setting. I bought 1 kg of LARGE shrimp, looked at the boy weighing and choosing my shrimp. The disappointment came when I sat at the stall and asked to fry it (I don't want to mention the name) The shrimp arrived very tasty but the big prawns (it came on top) When we went to eat the inside there were only tiny shriveled shrimp (old ones) ) As if they exchanged a good part. So far so good, when the shrimp ended I realized that it had about 20 heads without the body as if it were leftovers ... I called the waiter in disguise and he just made sure he did not listen and went to another table. I really felt like a muggle. Anyway, I ask you to pay attention, the place is great. I loved it, I will be back, but to eat a fish, because shrimp I only buy to take and fry at my house.\n",
      "I went to La Bocca after reading so many complimentary and excited comments. First of all, I want to say that I don't understand why some criticize the location so much. It is a quiet, residential street, whose houses are very reminiscent of Rio's suburbs. A grace! Now I will talk about the food. I ordered the highly praised plantain gnocchi with ossobuco ragout. The first mouthful is delicious, but, little by little, it becomes nauseating given the absence of nuances, textures and layers of flavors. The ossobuco sauce sins the excess salt. Overall, a correct dish, but nothing splendid. I emphasize, however, that it is an oasis to eat pasta made at home in that Rio de Janeiro populated with frozen third-party pasta disguised as gnocchi.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant!The diversity of the self served very high taste and unmatched flavors!The only restaurant I can eat sushi and saschimi with total food security!I am number one and super recommended!\n",
      "I liked the food as much as the service, the price is good and the location is reasonable, I have nothing to complain about, I recommend\n",
      "One of the best restaurants with vegetarian buffet with grill options in the center of Porto Alegre. The options are varied and very well done. Soups, desserts and refreshments included in the price. Very good value for money!\n",
      "Everything is good! Chef Juarez is great and a love. Great service. Great presentation of the dishes. Wonderful food. Incredible desserts. Good price. Without a doubt my favorite.\n",
      "The DR LASER Family was on Saturday for an informal lunch ... A well prepared Grill and a very varied Buffet with an ok price, make the place a good option for a quick weekend lunch.\n",
      "Indescribable, I had never eaten tapioca and decided to try it in Natal-RN, I ate in some places, but by far this was the best. The only place in our stay that we made a point of repeating, even though we knew we could lose another attraction, but it was worth the risk of losing a new attraction, because this place is just wonderful. Go prepared, because the portion is well served and the dessert is huge! We tried some, but the best was Carne de Sol with Cream! ! !\n",
      "He had seen the criticism and really expected more. The service was great and everything was fresh, but it wasn't the best ceviche I've ever had. Well gourmet. The very small portion.\n",
      "This restaurant is located on Avenida Conde, easily accessible to those in the center and the surrounding area. It mixes contemporary dishes with a tendency to those of the Iberian peninsula. Try the starters, for example the ragout. An excellent choice is also the Mediterranean. Attentive waiters and warm atmosphere leave us with a taste for more. Worth the visit.\n",
      "Located a little far from the center, it is a quiet place with great structure (very good and comfortable tables and chairs).The menu is a little weak due to the size of the restaurant .. there is not much variety of portions.It's great because it doesn't get too crowded, and the sea ahead is very calm.Average service.\n",
      "I had lunch with friends at this place and I really have to comment, delicious food, draft beer, excellent service, nothing to complain about, a place for families, couples and a group of friends.\n",
      "The place is very beautiful and has beers from other countries, but the prices are quite salty and the service was not the best.\n",
      "The bar was packed, so far without problems, after all it was December 30th.The biggest issue was, the very rude promoter, a total disorganization regarding the clearance of the tables and the air conditioning was far from working, the doors open without the wind curtain equipment, it only made it worse.Trying to order drinks at the bar didn't help either, the waiters are all located in one place at the counter, you need to be waving the command or squeezing the tip where they are serving.The minimum we expect from a beachfront bar is to work very well in the summer.The evaluation is very compromised, I was unable to drink or eat anything.\n",
      "Loopfood is one of the best sandwiches in Curitiba. Light, tasty and well seasoned, there's no mistake when you're hungry. The request is to eat together with a juice, there is no way to say no.\n",
      "Good service, fair price, very good food, very pleasant, the place at night has a beautiful people super recommend\n",
      "Tereza's house is for me the best in Salvador! Starting with the location, in the most bohemian neighborhood of Salvador, in an old house, with rustic decor, accompanied by the sound of a grand piano, which harmonizes so well with the elaborate menu.It goes beyond a gastronomic experience. See, hear, feel ...Bahian cuisine under a sensitive and daring touch makes this restaurant exceptional.\n",
      "The restaurant's presentation is an attraction in itself, all decorated with Northeastern themes! The tapiocas are delicious, huge, also offers couscous, salads, juices and smoothies. Very good!\n",
      "The worst thing that can happen in a restaurant is that you are cheated. I chose the filet mignon dish with the wood sauce and when the dish arrived there was only a small slice of very hard meat, which, as I understand it, was a hard leg. It shouldn't have been even 50 grams, it was a small, thin slice. The restaurant's unfortunate attitude was once good.\n",
      "Single price vegetarian restaurant with the right to repeat food and juices, but I felt full right away on the first dish and juice. Do you accept credit card. There is a lack of dishes with lighter seasoning, more colorful presentation and less nauseating aroma. Going without meat is not easy, if vegetarian dishes are not tasty it is difficult to return.\n",
      "Place with typical and specialized food in carne de sol, which comes with string beans, manioc, pirão de leite, .... A plate for two and left over, in our case. Fair price and excellent service. goat.\n"

      "It is a good restaurant that, for great, lacks more varieties. Inside the hotel there is a talented singer who sings well.\n",
      "I already knew the house, as always Wonderful food, atmosphere, music all perfect, but Francisco (Chico) ..... the best service, the best, beer and cold sparkling wine and always tireless. Congratulations on the best waiter.\n",
      "The menu has been refurbished for years, giving less focus to wraps and crepes. At lunch there are good grills at a compatible price. Very tasty food. The juices are great!\n",
      "The location of the restaurant is already worth it ... It is inside the Mangal das Garças - place we love !! We were very well attended but we found it expensive for what it provides .... It presents typical dishes with peculiar flavors in the self-service scheme with fixed price !!!\n",
      "The place is delicious for a beer on a sunny day mostly. The food is good as is the service. But prepare the pocket, as it is easy for the account to exceed 100 reais per person.\n",
      "A perfect restaurant for those looking for regional food. A very kind place on earth. Good for you to go with family friends. Very delicious food.\n",
      "Nice and relatively stripped down. Attentive but not excellent service. Reasonable drink menu, some good beer brands are missing. Pizza well done, but not delicious. In summary, the location is good but not great. Rio de Janeiro is in need.\n",
      "A restaurant with unique flavors and varieties. Excellent dishes and very good service.\n",
      "Wonderful hamburger with first class ingredientsExcelent receptionAnd clean and cozy environment.\n",
      "Nilo Peçanha's health was better and cleaner. I ordered a natural chicken sandwich and came a pile of leaves with shredded chicken and an indecipherable yellow sauce, tasteless and falling apart. I don't think they ever cleaned glass or did maintenance on the deck, left. Feather.\n",
      "Quick and affordable snacks, a good choice for the weekend with friends or children. Good menu and service\n",

      "Pleasant atmosphere, with good music and service note 10. Congratulations to waitress Iraci, very attentive!\n",
      "Spaces and with 3 different environments, the drinks are great, the options of appetizers and food on the menu are factual and please everyone and the prices are fair.Sometimes the service leaves a little to be desired, but for that it is not very demanding you may not even notice the delay.\n",
      "The hall is large and the tables accommodate groups. At the entrance a shelf with wines that you can choose and order at the table. The starters are excellent, but small. The pasta with bourgnion sauce is delicious!\n",
      "I love McDonald´s sandwiches, especially the Big Mac and today I tried the Super Big Mac at Shopping Recife, made with three hamburgers and it was even more delicious, super delicious ... I loved it! I also like ice cream a lot! In short ... I'm a fan! LOL\n",
      "Spread throughout the capital of Paraná, Restaurante Madero is a hamburger specializing in hamburgers and steaks.\n",
      "Self-service, located close to large companies. The value of kg is very cheap and the meat is good.\n",
      "Beautiful and super cozy place! Excellent music. Great service, super attentive waiters! Antipasti table with lots of options! Price justifies the quality!\n",
      "I found the pastry very good. A very large pastry with a lot of filling. Offers good variety of beers too.\n",
      "The facilities of the place already draw attention: with Italian characteristics, beautiful! The menu has many options of salads, starters, breads made by yourself, all very fresh! .. the coffees are excellent, served not in cups, but in ceramic bowls, I loved it! for those who like to try new things - walnuts, cheese, honey accompaniments - and a purposefully rustic atmosphere and a good choice. Despite the slightly spiced price, it is worth the visit !.\n",
      "Good food, good atmosphere, compared to Camarões Natal RN, it leaves something to be desired, starting with the service.\n",
      "It is very good when it has promotion, because the price is not very affordable, and the food does not match the normal pressure.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant.There were two units when I went to Maceió: one close to the Craft Fair and another close to the Mercure Hotel. We went with a couple of friends together. They are different environments (the menu is the same): next to the Fair they have a more relaxed and young atmosphere with live music. Near the Mercure the lounge is closed and an environment with more families. I recommend the Shrimp Gum! You will not regret!!!\n",
      "Big Nectar is that kind of place that saves your life in the middle of a busy day, that you're in a hurry. The service is super fast, they accept cards and have several types of snacks, sandwiches and natural juices.\n",
      "I go to Felipe a lot, for me Portuguese food is the best in the world. I start with cod or octopus with white wine and finish with lamb and red wine. Dessert, always, french toast!\n",
      "Eric, is a waiter at Coco Bambu Sul. Excellent service, attentive, friendly and seeks to expedite all orders quickly.\n",
      "I was with my family at Coco Bambu near Beira Mar in Fortaleza and ordered a dish that always like in São Paulo and without exception always comes out wonderful. But on this visit the Beira Mar branch was very disappointed with the dish. First the quantity of Cameroon was extremely reduced, and with that what came was potato straw and rice that was dry. I complained to the waiter who agreed with the criticism, and told me that the Maitre d 'would come to the table, which I am waiting for so far. Summary, lousy dish and no attitude from the house staff. Unfortunate. The bill was over R $ 270.00.\n",
      "Perhaps the best meat (or at least cost benefit) in Porto Alegre is served here. It is not a traditional gaucho barbecue, but a Uruguayan grilled parrilla. The simple atmosphere, with attentive and well-prepared waiters, invites you to excellent Uruguayan cuts. Don't forget to order the provolone cheese, a must!\n",
      "I expected more from the service and especially the food ... nothing stupendous ... normal, satisfactory and average.\n",
      "I spent Friday night with family at the restaurant, and decided to opt for a menu option other than the buffet since I wasn't going to eat much. My boyfriend went to the buffet and brought rice, but said he didn't want to eat until the end. So I tried only the rice from his buffet - a common practice when we go as a couple and want to try each other's food. Well, in the end the bill came as a portion of extra rice (as if I had taken advantage of the situation to eat rice) and as if it had been two portions, with a value above that indicated on the menu. My disappointment was extreme, due to the lack of education and preparation of care.\n",
      "The place is simple, but the food is good and reasonably priced. It is possible to order and take it home.\n",
      "I found out I was one of the best, so I wanted to take the test! Great! I ordered cod and Pastel de Belém which left nothing to be desired than what I ate in Portugal! Added to a good wine and good chat! I recommend!\n",
      "The best late afternoon snack in Porto Velho. Regional and Pará food, with the best crab soup.Tip: the tempting cake is perfect\n",
      "A menu of great natural and tasty options, well executed and with great service. Every time I eat at Frutaria, I keep thinking that I have to go back to try another dish.\n",
      "The place is located in a beautiful Vilela in Petrópolis, and has outdoor and indoor tables. I went at night, the service was good and fast. I ordered a divine shrimp crepe (R $ 22) and my husband ordered a filet mignon (R $ 35). The only thing left to be desired was the rice, completely unsalted. The rest, I loved it!\n"

      "The atmosphere is very pleasant, the menu very good, with some very typical dishes. The decor is very beautiful, with the pictures on the landscape wall and the bar with the horizontal mirror on the top. However, it is not physically like an Italian restaurant. Typical Italian restaurants have traditional set (or semi-set) tables with traditional chairs and do not have the configuration of tables with American cafeteria stalls and not even drinks like iced teas ... I worked 10 years ago in an Italian Restaurant in Italy , so I understand that this part was a commercial addition to the restaurant that doesn't exist in Italy. But overall, it is a very pleasant experience.\n",
      "The service was good and the fried fish dish with pirao was very good. I recommend this place as well as Lopanna.\n",

      "Sorry to beer fans Brahma and Cia., But there is nowhere near a good place to taste good beers. Let us start with the letter of 'specials', as the Teresinense calls the artisanal ones and a couple of imported ones, like Stella Artois etc. A place that could have a beer sommelier, in addition to real beer taps, like wheat, Ale, IPA, among other options that in any store that has the name BEER in the name we can find. The guys who serve us don't know the glasses for each style; we are not offered something to harmonize with the particular style that was requested ...Anyway, those who like it there are because they want to watch TV or be seen in a bar at a shopping mall in THE ...\n",
      "I love the Usina's long rifle, the sauces are excellent, but the big difference, really, is the pasta. Unfortunately always full, it is difficult to get lunch there ... however, depending on the day, it is worth it ....\n",

      "Nothing so interesting except the tapioca and crepes made to order that are a marvel. But the rest of the breakfast buffet is average and so is the service; I hope they improve in that aspect.\n",
      "note 10 service .. attentive service excellent dishes very well.served and attended we will definitely return\n",
      "The place is pleasant. The food is good and the service is also an excellent experience in the city of Porto Velho for those who like good Brazilian food, especially mineira. It is worth knowing and enjoying\n",

      "Simple but tasty food. We ordered a fillet that was very well served, an expensive dish, but that serves up to 03 people satisfactorily ... Delicious empadinha and codfish cake!\n",
      "This is the best Christmas steakhouse, with a varied meat and fish menu, personalized service. For those who like Japanese food, they will be delighted because the sushi is magnificent. But for my family the noble steak was wonderful and the roasted lamb was also divine. It also has a selection of incredible desserts. I recommend.\n",
      "Excellent pizza, thin crust, made in a wood oven. Wonderful place for those who want to see and be seen ... well frequented, always have a waiting line. Best to make a reservation ... It has a unique wine cellar that is worth exploring.\n",

      "The barbecue is delicious and the side dishes too, but the price is a little bit salty, but the quality, flavor and service make up for the value.\n",
      "a great draft beer with a bit of a tumultuous service because you find it a lot on Fridays, but the waiters try hard to leave you the best service possible.The portions are delicious\n",
      "R $ 61.90 kg in September / 16The best top hat I ate in Natal.In addition, if you want to try regional food, this is the perfect place.A very varied buffet, all very well done and warm.Unparalleled service. Very attentive waiters.Top 5:Cassava bread, sweet or salted; juices (some mixed); the meat with cream; cheese cake; hidden meat from the sun ....In addition there is risotto, Baião de dois, green beans, various soups, breaded fish, breaded chicken, couscous, hominy, cheese table, salad ......You have to be very focused to not eat a little of everything.Detail: the dish is huge! Make no mistake about the amount you put in it.Detail 2: they have an internal store that sells a lot: some sweets, avoador, regional items and even the famous mangai bread. Even an individual couscous pot sells ...Detail 3: I saw a couple of tables celebrating their birthday there.Different place and very good food!\n",
      "When we visited the Bamboo poop, surprised by the service par excellence of Garson Ronaldo Martins, we note 10 congratulations to the Bamboo poop for having a professional of this level.France da Silva12/16/2019\n",
      "great pizza, really delicious with excellent ingredients and flavors that escape the traditional .... very welcoming atmosphere, attentive staff .... only negative point is the time: the house closes at midnight but long before they are removing the salad buffet and end the rotation for which I was disappointed by the size of the establishment. I had eaten a few pizzas around the clock (+ - 11 pm) until the waiter came to ask me if there was any particular flavor that was waiting ..... after eating the flavors that I brought, I did the same with the sweets ... I ended up eating little variety .... I found it very disrespectful to the customer even for the amount paid, which is not at all cheap.\n",
      "The restaurant offers good dishes, does not have a quick service but it is worth going for lunches anyway.At lunch, it offers music played on an exposed piano in the middle of the restaurant, with a lot of vegetation.\n",
      "Churrasquinho do Japa is good value for money, well located and with good food. The skewer is worth it, the garnishes are well prepared. However, as a negative factor, the lack of cooling is felt in the hottest days.\n",
      "As I passed the door of this little Italian trattoria, I was already curious, because the atmosphere is very charming and inviting; then I went with friends to dinner and I had a great surprise, a lean but honest wine list, full and tasty dishes, very efficient and friendly service, and entitled to two complimentary lemoncellos at the end. Now ... dessert was not exciting, and I believe that several restaurants have hired the ready-made confectionery part through specialized companies, which unfortunately leaves something to be desired.\n",
      "good options on the menu, quality products, fair prices, good service, easy access, worth knowing.\n",
      "You will never imagine that you will find such good cod in Manaus. My husband has lived in different parts of the world and Alentejo is his favorite restaurant.Sophisticated, elegant and pleasant atmosphere.Everything is good, the cod, the vegetables and even the rice!Impeccable service! Geraldo and Tati are very professional and dear.It's worth taking a shirt if it's too cold;)I recommend it, even for tourists (who normally seek regional cuisine). Surely you will be surprised.\n",

      "Although there is sometimes a queue, it is a restaurant that offers good food. There are salad options, quiches, all very well prepared. It looks very small from the outside, but when you enter, you notice that the environment is not so small.\n",
      "When I think of crab, only Caranga comes to mind ... I've been to others, none of them compare with the quality of the crabs there. Tasty ... loose the shell ... the mush with shrimp inside ... hmmm ... not to mention the perfect service and super nice environment. ..\n",
      "Good and expensive airport cafeteria! Coffee is always good, but prices remain high. The service remains good and fast.\n",
      "Great restaurant and excellent service from Waiter Marciel always very attentive to customers. THX.\n",

      "A regular at the Due Cuochi at Shopping Cidade Jardim, we decided to celebrate my daughter's birthday at Henri Dunant's house. The experience was the best possible. Although relatively crowded, it is quiet, spacious and very well decorated. The service is excellent and very careful. The wine list offers a good variety and the dishes, especially the pasta, are very tasty.A rarity nowadays in São Paulo, there is free valet parking on site.We will be back for sure.Hope this helps.\n",
      "As an excellent regional restaurant. But this is not a regional restaurant, but a mix of regional / traditional / tourist / international and may even include contemporary delicacies / gourmets / damoda and others in its category. Varied and special dishes on a menu that already makes your mouth water and the eagerness of how it will taste. Tasty starters that differ from the sameness of other restaurants. Wonderful hot chick: said the waiter, be the flagship. Pleasant atmosphere, tables made of wooden trunks give the environment an Amazonian air. At the entrance a small carpet cleans feet, out of step with the risk of slips that can go to the regulars. Wine list compatible with the house specialties. Good quality customer service. I will return and recommend ..\n",
      "Very pleasant call with great service. Everyone was very attentive. Food well served with great portion. It's really worth it\n",
      "An extremely comfortable restaurant, impeccable service, air-conditioned and with great meat options, the place has a warm, calm atmosphere and with a piano played live, which leaves a perfect atmosphere (The pianist is great), the dishes are very satisfactory , both in quality, quantity and presentation, mr. Freire (Maîte), is an excellent professional, he reminded me, I'm from São Paulo, and I hadn't visited him in 1 year, it was gratifying to see him again. For me, it is one of the best places in Fortaleza, it is the 5th time that I go and I do not miss visiting them, I certainly recommend, note 10.\n",
      "I liked having eaten at El Arabe Culinaria Chohfe, because a food with an excellent seasoning, I hope you can eat the sphinx from there again.\n",

      "Very good pasta, excellent fillings, the ones I like most are beef jerky and dulce de leche; with excellent price.\n",
      "I always went ahead, and I confess that the smell of cake was a temptation. Until one day I decided to come in and take this delight home. For what sir, now I am addicted, it is law to leave work and stop by to get a cake. Homemade bread is wonderful too. Congratulations all very perfect, done with care and love.\n",
      "Good for “having a drink” with friends, cheap and cold beer.A little time consuming service, I believe that because of the full tent, but at least they don't charge 10%.Excellent starters!\n",

      "Although the unit is already a few years old, it was the first time I was there. The environment is simple and friendly. I liked the service, because the waiters were very attentive. The meat was very good, although the sauce that accompanied it was a little too strong for my taste (maybe it could be optional or have other options). Although the footprint of the place is simple, I would like to suggest that the cutlery should be changed when the main dish arrives, as they had already been used in the salad plate. However, in the end, the bill seemed quite heavy for such a simple dinner.\n",
      "Excellent service, variety of sushi and sashimi.And the most interesting is the innovative system of rotation, with low waste and high variety. I recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "I bought 03 ice creams and after consuming they came to claim internal rules of charging 1.00 more for each one when paying by credit or debit card. They say they can do that because it is in the law. But the law does not speak of values ​​or forms of payment !!! They refused to understand the law. It was a total inconvenience. They are assaulting customers !!! Cashier Sassá, says his name is Julielson, he refused to call the owner, says he is called Gleidson, to solve the problem and even made fun of the case !!! In short, terrible location. An assault on customers on their rights.In the images are the official law and their law in the pen, fixed in hidden places in the bakery.DO NOT BUY, DO NOT GO THERE. AVOID PASSING DISORDER.I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO MY ENEMY.\n",
      "I have been at least four times, and none of the dishes were highlighted. Average dishes, the extremely watery moqueca. We ordered fish from Belle Meunière to take home, at a cost of R $ 120.00, a ridiculous amount, when the indication is that it serves two people.I would not return.\n",
      "meat to the point, family atmosphere, great service especially to the one who served us was the attentive and polite orlando took all our doubts and made the night more pleasant, it was a pleasure to be in this restaurant one more made me feel at home and I hope to return soon\n",
      "For me, one of the best meats in Fortaleza. Pleasant atmosphere, quality service. A real Argentine barbecue.\n",
      "Tapioca is a delight. has several flavors. I ordered sun-dried meat with rennet cheese (which I love!). At lunch there is buffet per kilo. Varied menu. They even serve cod! R $ 60.00 a kilo ... kinda pulled, right?\n",
      "Regular carvery barbecue, but the rib is special. Soft like no other. Specialty of the house that attracts people from different places. Who hasn't been, don't miss this good option.\n",
      "The red grill is very well located, a simple and airy rustic atmosphere, with ideal light, tailored service, with cold drinks and offers a meat menu in the right measure with variety and very well made. The best and the taste. Just be careful with the point of the meats. Because the point is important for those who appreciate meat. Ask for help if you need it.\n",
      "It is literally a breakfast in the countryside. A fee of 33.00 / person is paid and, thus, can be served at will. As options there was couscous, beiju, scrambled egg, cooked and shredded sun meat, breads, jam, dulce de leche, savory pies, cheese bread, assorted cakes, juices, coffee, milk, sweet porridge .. The place is ideal for children: many toys (houses, swing), some animals (oxen, rabbits, chickens, fish). The place only works on Sundays.\n",
      "Sensational!We ordered the Super Summer dish.Super nice atmosphere, very good service and the food without comment.I highly recommend it.\n",
      "What madness this pizzeria !! The place is beautiful, the service is different, courteous, welcoming, responsible and very affectionate! The pizzas are so inexplicable they are so good. Just prpvando really! The flavors are varied and one better than the other! Really an incredible experience and worth what it costs or even more! Parking next door with valet. It is paid, but the car stays close and well taken care of. WORTH IT!!!Congratulations for the establishment and a warm hug in the team of collaborators, we were delighted with the service!\n",
      "Excellent food and well served portion. Differentiated service and above 3 people the cost benefit is super affordable.\n",
      "Very good pizza with a variety of flavors. The value is not the cheapest. But it's worth it to eat quality pizza.\n",
      "Even though I didn't like beiju very much, the friends encouraged me and it tasted very good. Lots of variety and freshly made.\n",
      "We went (2 couples) to try this Ragazzo (Jardim Marajoara) last Sunday, October 29th. The panino we ordered, ... didn't have! The red fruit milkshake, ... it hadn't! We ordered two Pica Pau mugs, ... we didn't have one! The onion soup was sour, I didn't even eat it! The meatballs from spaghetti with meatballs to sugo looked like they were made with leftover cooked meat! Two employees (apparently more senior because they were dressed in black) were fighting all the time in a corner of the room. The door of the establishment was open all the time !!! It must be to try to blow the air conditioning (?), Or to allow a better entrance in the room of the exhaust gases of the high traffic (?), Or to hinder the access by the ramp (?). Simply infamous!\n",
      "Nice atmosphere, good music.Outside there is a pool table, late afternoon or evening should be nice.The dishes are more pasta, which is not fresh homemade, pomodoro or white sauce with a meat, not excited.\n",
      "Ara is a super interesting restaurant, with Korean food, I found the food taste really cool, it is very spicy and has that touch of bittersweet food.\n",
      "The bar has excellent aperitifs, the band is lively and the style is chorinho, samba .. The only negative point is the time to get a table and the value of high season tickets. The feijoada on Sundays is the highlight. Excellent, the best I've ever eaten!\n",
      "Nice atmosphere, good service !! Dishes for all tastes .... in the beginning the crab cone is a great option !!! I ordered the famous shrimp gum that comes with 5 cheese options and I found it very tasty (while hot, when the cheese gets cold and hard and sickly) the other people who were with me tried the lobster clever (TOP), shrimp with catupiry ( TOP tbm), shrimp in butter with herbs from the garden (excellent) and filet mignon in a wine and green pepper sauce with noodles in a parmesan sauce (a little hard meat) for dessert petit gateau (very good) and passion fruit mousse with mango jam rose and tapioca ice cream (typical dessert delight) anyway, it's worth it! Super recommend!\n",
      "A fine restaurant, well structured, very well decorated.Wonderful food, very hearty portions.Very tasty food and divine seasoning.Where you can eat prawns prepared in an infinite variety.\n",
      "The buffet is typical, fresh, delicious food. The star was due to the risotto if duck made fresh. We think the 57 reais is a little high, and the service leaves a lot to be desired.\n",
      "A great find of typical Goiás food, those who are in the city should try at least the fish on the tile and the small pot. An excellent restaurant, I recommend it!\n",
      "Kibe or michui plus a little salad, wonderful option for lunch. All very tasty. I will come back whenever I am in São Paulo.\n",
      "For twenty reais you can serve yourself at will without repeating. The food is good, well prepared and varied, but from time to time the food is cold at the buffet.\n",
      "We always go and love Chalet Suisse, traditional in Curitiba, classic in the fundue. This time I thought it fell slightly, both in the variety of fundue sauces and in the service. It is still very good, however, we did not feel that desire to return as in other times.\n",
      "Plenty of options in self service, exceptional quality! I recommend the salmon. The price matches the quality of the food!\n",
      "Regarding the service, menu, ambience, price, agility, it is difficult for someone not to like this restaurant. I'll be back for sure because there are many good options to try\n"

To those in love with shrimp, I leave two tips: the portion of shrimp cakes and the portion of shrimp breaded with sesame. Worth every penny (and look it costs a lot of cents)!\n",
      "I spent years attending the kitchenette, mainly with my friends. I really liked the menu and the quality of the food / drinks.About 3 years ago I went a few times, but not successfully. Last time (2 days ago), I decided not to go back. First, the waiter who served me did not know that there was a drink menu. Afterwards, the sandwich I ordered was dry ... The waiters were not attentive and seemed to be upset about something ...It is true that the starter we ordered (a mince of steak with mushroom sauce) was really wonderful. But, to be honest, it was the only positive aspect ...\n",
      "Yesterday my husband made a reservation to celebrate my birthday.At the first contact, they rudely warned that after 8:30 pm the occupation of the tables is on a first come, first served basis. They sent us to the first floor without even showing us the way. We sat down and ordered the menu 3 times. After about 20 minutes we received them and during the choice of dishes I checked the information that they do not accept cards, only checks or cash. An absurdity in the middle of Ipanema and the XXI century. I don't think it's a good idea to have at least R $ 500.00 in your bag, at night in Rio de Janeiro to pay for dinner. We got up and decided to leave for another restaurant. The valet returned the car, all dirty with cement, as they parked it at the Metro construction site. We left for Restaurante D'Amici in Leme, where we were well served, where the grouper ravioli with prawns and saffron sauce was divine.\n",
      "Excellent service, extremely pleasant atmosphere, dishes with good presentation are very tasty! Fair price. Gastronomic experience!\n",
      "Restauranfe excels even for those who don't like fish or seafood. When I stay at Fasano I always dine there and I really like it. I rarely go when I'm not at the hotel because I'm Al Mare and I don't like fish. The only thing that has always intrigued me is that wall that covers the views of one of the most beautiful scenery in the world, which is the sea of ​​Rio. But the treatment and sophistication of the place is without prejudice.\n",

      "Very nice place, great to go with friends and or boyfriend, for having a pleasant atmosphere and a very beautiful view.\n",
      "We went to the restaurant with the suggestion of a friend. We were at Savassi and we got there quickly. The big surprise was the sauces that accompanied the two dishes we ordered. Very tasty! A portion of surubim with such an auntie sauce was very tasty! We also ordered a trio of tilapia, linguicinha and manioc cakes. This trio accompanied a lemon sauce and another that looked like barbecue. Anyway, all very good! And, to top it off, chilled beers! And the price is very easy. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Top quality cuisine. Simple atmosphere with extremely attentive owners, homemade pasta that reminds us of Italy. I recommend everyone to visit maceio. Unmissable.\n",

      "The Nova Anarella pizzeria I know is at 2254 Oratorio street. Medium pasta with and without catupiry filling (original) on the edge, first-rate ingredients. Open every day for delivery in the region\n",
      "The bar is on the edge of the beach, has ambient sound, live music, good snacks and cold dishes and beers. The positive point of this Bar is the values ​​of the dishes and beers, compared to Rio de Janeiro. I recommend\n",
      "I looked for the tip here on tripadvisor and it was perfect! I tried a reservation at 20:00 but it didn't happen. We went straight and arrived at 20:30, with a queue for 2 people of 30 min.

      "It's a small, dark place. Meals are good. I've eaten the feijoada and Parmegiana. The service is regular.\n",
      "I've already visited this Pizza Hut to eat at the restaurant and to order takeaway and, honestly, I don't know what's worse! The service is terrible, without exaggeration. Lack of attention to the customer, the biggest bad mood of all employees, not to mention the waiting time that is ridiculously long. After all that, hope your order comes right! The cleaning of the salon and the bathroom is very precarious! On-site parking for R $ 15. It is simply not worth the effort! I won't be back!\n",
      "The restaurant offers two environments:At the entrance, buteco-style tables and countertops, the draft beer is taken appropriately and there are light and dark options, snacks and meals are excellent options, since the cod dumpling and the cod bait with potatoes are exceptional in this environment. the prices and presentation of the dishes and snacks are more modest, without missing the quality and flavor of the house.The restaurant is a lounge and mezzanine with air conditioning, the dishes range from R $ 90.00 to R $ 140.00, serve 3 hungry adults or 4 educated adults well and what is served justifies the price. My favorite option at the house is Bacalhau à Zé do Pipo, where the pieces of cod, three fingers high, are placed on top of onions and covered by a mashed potato and black olives, all of this gratin. It is to eat while praying. Be sure to try the codfish cake.\n"

      "I have been going to this restaurant for many years. The atmosphere is very familiar, it is well hidden, but it has its own parking. The land has a lot of trees so you feel transported to the middle of a small forest. The service is excellent and the owner herself passes by the tables to greet everyone. It is a German restaurant, but still has vegetarian options. They have a cover charge that comes a little from each entry which is great, but more suitable for non-vegetarians. The beer menu is quite extensive. I ordered the cheese Spatzle and it is very good, my husband and my mother ordered a dish that also comes with a little of each main dish and they loved it. The price is quite salty, but it is worth it, and does not accept any card, only check, cash and visa or master (debit).\n",

      "I went for a business lunch. The taste of the food passes, but it could be much better. The service at lunch is slow and confusing. Why go to a restaurant like this when there are better options with disbursements at the same level? I doubt if I would return. It's not bad, but it's nothing that makes you want to return.\n"

It typically serves regional food with flavors from the northeast of Brazil. A very large place that favors the volume of people who seek to know the restaurant, not only for the food but also for the smallest details in the decoration and proposal. In the morning and late afternoon you can have a delicious country coffee. Plenty of dishes. Congratulations to the owners for their whim, who visits Sergipe must visit this place at least once. In addition to tasty food, it is an immersion in Northeastern culture. Everything neat, from the rattle to call the waiters to the typical sale (trade characteristic of the interior) to pay for what you consumed. I loved it!\n",

Even so we went. A long wait. There is no priority there ..... we sat hungry the dinner was terrible fish washed risotto tomato porridge. We tried to complain but to no avail.

      "I haven't been to the bar in a while, but I had great reference to delicious northeastern food. But it seems that the delicious food at the bar was only in memory. The carne de sol came with a great taste of smoke and the food in general quite salty and with little seasoning. A feather.\n",
      "Steakhouse with a slightly salty price, but with wonderful dishes such as seafood, the lobster is a delight and the crab cone too (just a little sickening). The barbecue that is the main one, is a show, delicious and juicy meat added to that super cold Malzbier to accompany! I recommend!\n",

I went on Friday 08/03/18 and it was packed, there weren't enough tables.

      "Pleasant atmosphere, typical Italian menu where the strongest are the pasta, but you also find meat, fish and chicken, as well as salads and entrees. The Italian bread, which arrives hot on the table, with the olive oil served in a separate dish is unbeatable. The service could be much more careful. It does not compromise, but leaves something to be desired. The portions are good and have a specific menu for children, which makes it a lot easier. Coffee should not be dispensed, as it is very tasty.\n",

He gives 10 to 0 at any bar there.Service is one of the bar / restaurant's strongest points. Managers, employees and even the owner are very friendly, know how to welcome all types of customers and never forget an order. Honesty also adds a positive point, because if any dish is delayed they will tell you exactly why the delay (for example, because the house is full and with many orders in line).The food is amazing! One of the best picanhas in São Paulo's rechaud and other side dishes and delicious dishes. They know how to innovate too, always keeping the menu updated with new options and maintaining the constant renovation of the establishment.In relation to drinks, there is a great diversity of draft beer (always cold) and they are made to the measure of the customer (little collar, normal or too collar) just ask!

At the beginning we ordered the couvert (excellent baguette with a pepper butter and honey) and the pork croquette which was very tasty. As a main dish a Lamb rice that was excellent!

The main dish is grilled sole, puree with three roots, vegetables and basil pesto sauce.The only thing I don't like about the place is that because it is small, the tables and chairs are small and do not invite you to stay in the restaurant for a long time.\n",
      "The sun meat in this restaurant is excellent. I ate sun meat of this quality only in a restaurant that is Picuí in Maceió. Excellent service, beautiful restaurant and amazing food. Everything was tasty and well served. Juicy sun meat and very good garnishes. The banana candy is also licking your lips.\n",
      "The pizza is thin and very crunchy and the filling is tasty. I loved eating with a glove. This option exists precisely because it is thin and crunchy. Sangria is delicious and combines with pizza. The super interesting indoor environment, collection of photographic cameras on the walls and record players.\n",
      "Excellent pasta and excellent meat. I didn't even realize that the specialty was pizzeria. Excellent cost-benefit ratio when compared to restaurants on the RJ-SP axis.\n",
      "I found the food tasty. But both my dish and that of my company came cold.I recommend the Burgers. The potato is good.\n",
      "Very nice place attentive waiters and the restaurant to my surprise does not charge 10% of the service. The dishes are tasty, very well served as a single quantity. If you go as a couple, most likely there will be food left over. They should create the option with half a plate / portion. Charging 60% of the value of the dish. Sometimes less more.\n",
      "We ate a delicious starter: mixed tide - squid rings and shrimp. Wonderful flavor! Main course: prawns in a savory sauce- very well served ... very fresh prawns, creamy rice and sauteed potatoes in butter. I couldn't eat dessert! We ate too much! Super recommend! Cozy place, great service and fair price!\n",
      "We went to celebrate my husband's birthday and the service was excellent .... everything was perfect !!!!\n"

      "I have been to Café Viriato on two occasions when the service was extremely time consuming. The cafe was empty and I stayed for more than 30 minutes waiting for a tapioca accompanied by orange juice. I do not recommend the visit.\n",
      "Very good food, great service and cozy place. Dishes for 2 serve 3 or 4 easily. We eat sun-dried meat with manioc and rennet cheese. Very good!!!!\n",
      "My second time here.I came in search of fish except cod because the price is half salty.The other fish option was suribim, but I'm not a fan of freshwater fish.There was a Portuguese sardine as a starter on the menu. I ate it the other time and it wouldn't work out like lunch.It remained to choose the feijoada. It arrived but only had sausages, ribs and smoked loin. They saved money and there was not a single piece of foot, ear or rado that are the protsgonists in this dish.It looked like I had reservations coming into the field.In no way do I recommend the Baltazar feijoada. Besides, it is very expensive for the content.The seasoning is cool but not worth it. At least 10 better places than here for this dish.The worst is waiters who asked me if I liked it. I told this story and that's why. Nor do you call the chef or manager to at least hear a criticism and then consider whether to proceed or not.Lunch time poorly spent today (Saturday)\n",
      "There is a wide variety of dishes in the carvery. Service is common. Nothing exceptional. But if a person in your group wants to order a la carte and stay out of rotation, they won't be able to. They prefer to lose the table at the expense of the rules, even if the table is made up of adults.\n",
      "Great place. Beautiful sight. But on the weekend it gets crowded. You have to wait a lot. This is boring.\n",
      "Coffee well located and with a cozy atmosphere.Unfortunately there have been changes in management and some good things have been lost.Ok service (no longer cordial), lean menu and unattractive options.The price was adequate, but the quality of the meals changed so it is no longer worth it.I hope the coffee has good options again !!\n",
      "Located in an area specialized in restaurants, it offers kilo food at a fair price. well tidy and organized I recommend.\n",
      "The food is delicious and enough for those who eat little. It is a restaurant for a good conversation, a meeting, it is not for those who want to get fed up even because the price is a little expensive. The service is very good!\n",
      "The climate of the place is very pleasant for a lunch or coffee ... But avoid the place when it is fuller, as the staff gets in the way a little in the service and leaves something to be desired. Very good for quick snacks at times that are more empty.\n",
      "In a city where establishments (and their quality) usually have an expiration date, Roxy is an exception. Decades in the market with excellence. Simple yet fantastic food. The house is packed from Monday to Monday. And the saddam fillet is worth every calorie. Super affordable prices. Without comparison with any other.\n",
      "This pizza is very good !!! it is worth ordering with stuffed edge, because it is with catupiry cheese ... The price is compatible ... there are pizzas for 4 people from 48 reais\n",
      "Delicious esfras with an affordable price for all classes! However, juices and soft drinks with considerable value!\n",
      "I went to the ground fire on the first of the year.I found the service very poor.They served little variety of meat. The impression is that because of the little movement they did not put many types of meat.The garrisons were also very weak. They didn't serve fries, which I love with meat and other types of accompaniment, they only arrived at the end of lunch.\n",
      "Excellent service, super comfortable environment, for you who come to Teresina and prefer more refined dishes this is the place.\n",
      "I went on hibiscus and left extremely disappointed. The place is beautiful, good food, but they don't know how to choose their employees. After a long time in a queue inside the taxi waiting to clear our entrance, we went to the reception where we found a man and two young women. Such a gentleman, extremely rude and rude. He said little jokes, he treated us badly because we were going in the wrong direction. but what is his function there if it doesn't help the right place since he was at the reception and we didn't know? He preferred to make jokes, I said cute and he answered me very badly. We went in, settled down and went looking for the speedboat rides. To our misfortune we were once again attended to by that man who once again treated us badly. We asked the taxi driver who took us and he said that this happens frequently and that employee usually acts like this, so why doesn't the establishment take action? I felt offended and for that reason I consider it the most frustrating place we visited on our vacation. Would not indicate! It is not worth paying dearly and still being treated rudely.\n",
      "Super nice atmosphere with good service, but what I really liked was the food, especially the fish stew, a delight that serves the whole family.\n",
      "Excellent lunch, very good, very nice atmosphere to enjoy with friends and the best waiter here is Evandro\n",
      "Highly pleasant place. Everything you can imagine is there. From chairs with cushions to beds for massage. It turns out that practically everything is paid for, the exception being the umbrellas and chairs on the beach. In addition, the place is quiet and offers great options for snacks and portions!\n",
      "It is not a traditional Japanese restaurant.Hachiko has chefs with the ability to innovate and create within a gastronomic proposal that surprises even the usual customers. Regardless of how much is known of this segment, it is simply impossible not to be amazed by the creativity and quality of the results of the dishes.The chefs are true alchemists in the kitchen, which guarantees the restaurant a unique, exotic, and of course extremely tasty menu.Keep an open mind and heightened senses when entering, and have fun.\n",
      "Very nice food and atmosphere, all the waiters are very good, you feel at home ... you can find Cícero the best ...\n",
      "Divine and tasty food, highlight for Alex's Service, who was super attentive to us, including my daughter. Congratulations for the excellent professional. We will certainly be back.\n",
      "Good options for hamburgers, but always accompanied by French fries, without another option of accompaniment. Worse than the potato came salty. The burger was careful to ask for no salt, and it came right on.I also thought that the queuing system needs to pay more attention. One of the devices did not work, according to the receptionist it blew 3 times, and it caused me to be passed over by several customers who arrived well after. Did it cost to open the door and call by name ??\n",
      "Very nice buffet and carvery with easy location and quick service. Very good for those who are in the vicinity of hospitals or passing through Derby and Recife City Center. I recommend.\n",
      "The restaurant offers great meals, but does not support large numbers of people when necessary.\n",
      "It is a good self service restaurant. The food is good (large buffet with good quality and variety), the price is fair and in line with what is served. During the week, at lunch it is usually very full.\n",
      "Good place to eat fast or to spend time with friends. The space offers space for children and a menu that goes beyond fast food. Snacks are good and well prepared. The price is not the best in the city in this segment, but it is still worth it.\n",
      "all kinds of dishes, perfect food of great quality all made to order, gg size dishes (lol)a good price\n",
      "A warm, welcoming atmosphere that takes us on a trip to Patagonia Argentina, delicious food, excellent service. Beautiful and cozy place. External area!\n",
      "Traditional restaurant in Porto Alegre, open to the last customer (rare in a city where after 11:30 pm it is very difficult to have dinner)Meats on skewers, fillets, special mention to the salad cart that passes the table and the customer chooses.Ribs and tenderloin with cheese are the most requestedAffordable, has parking and family atmosphere\n",
      "I was at Sublime Burger last Saturday, I tried the hamburger Esplendido. In fact, very tasty !! A positive point is the parking space; we had no problems finding a spot on the street, which is very spacious and busy. However, I ended up taking the snack to go because there are very few tables and chairs in the place. I would very much like to have tried the rustic potatoes, my mouth watered; but we ended up not delaying the place as we waited on our feet until our snack came out.\n"

      "Anderson served us divinely well, savoring famous shrimp to delight our favorite dish ever.\n",
      "The customer can choose the carvery or food by the kilo for those who are in a hurry or don't want to eat a lot. The grill part is of good quality because the salmon was great. My colleague preferred meat and it was tough but they automatically replaced it with one that pleased my colleague. The sweet ambrosia was very good too. I think the salad part could have more variety because I didn't see broccoli. The price is different for those who choose jackdaws instead of choosing only what is on display.\n",
      "Great. Optimal quality. Fantastic service. Cold drink.You have the option of a quick lunch. Dinner is delicious.Total security, for being inside a mall.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant located inside the Brasil Tropical hotel, Saturday is the day of the traditional feijoada served buffet style, 50.00 per person, it is very worth visiting.\n",
      "The food is good, tasty and quality. The service is reasonable, but acceptable due to the capacity of the place. The negative point is the high price, which surprised us a lot. It is a good restaurant, I recommend it for its quality, but it is good to pay attention to the costs.\n",
      "Nice place, good food and excellent service from the waiter André Luiz. However, when we arrive, going to the tables, women are offering massage and when I denied it, one of them turned around and said she needed it, because I have a “tired face”. Lack of respect. If the person thinks he will win a customer with those words, the owner better review his employees.\n",
      "Excellent shrimp stew, it comes to the table bubbling, very well served and with many prawns. It can be considered a tourist restaurant, but it is worth it, the service is attentive and the price is fair.\n",
      "The restaurant is themed, super well decorated and personalized. The place is comfortable and the tourist is surrounded by the northeastern culture on all sides where he looks. As for the food, it is typical: couscous, mush, sun meat, hot coconut, green beans ... I found the food too greasy for my taste. Everything is loaded in seasoning and bathed in fat. The buffet is self service, R $ 59.90 Kg. Desserts are the part and tapiocas too. In my view everything could stay inside the buffet and not be charged separately.\n",
      "High quality restaurant. Excellent food, good service and very nice structure. Quite frequented by tourists. Those who come to Natal cannot fail to appreciate an excellent shrimp I recommend.\n",
      "The chopps, both dark and light, are excellent. This bar, located in a part of the city that was immortalized in the verses of Sampa, by Caetano, would be successful anywhere else. I recommend a portion of pastries to accompany the chopps.\n",
      "it is a good place to enjoy couscous, it comes in individual portions and has many options, it is worth it to vary a little from the traditional.\n",

      "A small, intimate restaurant with great food! Worth the visit! Congratulations to the Chief!\n",

      "cozy place, fast service and tasty food. sells everything, the dishes have cardio for you to choose from.\n",
      "Nowadays, one of the restaurants that I least recommend to people. The food was already very good, but nowadays, I don't appreciate it anymore. The service is good, the staff are good, but the values ​​are not worth it, as is the food.\n",
      "Excellent location and refined atmosphere and great taste. Food varied from different types of pasta to simple or sophisticated meats. The cellar is excellent and appeals to very demanding people. The price is right and the service is spectacular.\n",
      "Beautiful, clear, well decorated restaurant, very well located and full of beautiful people. The food is delicious and the service is very good.\n",
      "Excellent cost benefit !!Democratic dishes for all budgets and tastes ...The restaurant is simple, the service from Monday to Monday is done by the friendly couple, the waiters are all from Ceará ... simple and very polite.I recommend the visit, the lamb palette is sensational, oxtail, several types of baião for two ... very varied menu.\n",
      "Best restaurant and bar in Belo Horizonte! Cold beer and great service! I would like to praise the waiter Juliano! Excellent professional! I tasted 2 dishes: liver liver with jiló and dried meat with bottle manioc. Too bad that on Saturdays they don't serve tropeiro beans. A friend from Carolina, from the state of Maranhão wanted to try the tropeiro beans, typical of Minas Gerais, but there will be plenty of opportunities!\n",
      "It was my second disappointment, and certainly the last one, going to the restaurant.The starter was tasty, but it arrived cold.The main course, which was supposed to be a fillet escalope with risotto, came with a tiny piece of meat (barely larger than the size of a cherry tomato), and even questioning the waiter we were told that this was the correct portion.The dessert was awful, it looked like a dirty broth.The only good points are that the restaurant has a classic decor that is very interesting, and the waiters are attentive.\n",
      ".Champions to lose the number. Delicious sauce. Fast and attentive service. Beautiful and comfortable place. Speed ​​in serving the dish. Clean cutlery and dishes. Cold draft beer and frozen mug (sensational).\n",

      "The traditional and famous Argentine restaurant 348 has a branch in the elegant Jardins, more precisely in the old Le Lis Blanc store. The space is beautiful and the decoration and architecture of the refined store has been maintained. In terms of the environment, it is a score of 10. The empanadas are still delicious, as in the first restaurant that opened almost three decades ago near Hospital São Luís, and the new version of 348 was more similar to the restaurants of Porto Madero in Buenos Aires.\n",
      "The food is good, the price is fair, the service is fast, the place is simple, well ventilated, the bathroom clean and fragrant, and the gourmet passion fruit dindim is excellent. Super recommended, I loved the experience!\n",

      "The service and food were great. As it was a Saturday at lunch, the music was more lively and the mood was high.\n",
      "We went to the Imperium to eat a feijoada at the recommendation of a friend. We found out that in Belo Horizonte, it is not so easy to find a restaurant specializing in this food. Most are in Pampulha, close to the center is complicated. We ordered a feijoada for two. The dish is well served, well seasoned and at an honest price. The restaurant is within the cruise market. Worth it.\n",
      "Rustic environment with a relaxed and beautiful environment. There are rarely queues. On weekends it is good to arrive early or come with patience for the waiting line. I went on a Monday for lunch and there were no queues. The dishes are based on pork, but have an alternative menu. I ate a crackling entrado with delicious guava and a simpler dish (like an executive) that has roasted meat for hours (great), more side dishes (farofa, cabbage, bean tutu and banana tartar). Avoid if you are on a diet.\n"

      "I really did not understand the fame of this place, the food was good, but nothing too much, the mediocre atmosphere and the expensive price for what it offers, we ordered the prawn dish in strawberry and we have already eaten much more delicious and cheap ones, it didn’t positively affect me.\n",
      "Restaurant with a good 20 years of history, pleasant atmosphere and great French dishes. Duck magret, wellington steak, the famous guava souffle - all right. My only criticism is the new Asian dishes, some not so good. It remains one of the best places in SP to eat good French food.\n",

      "We waited a long time for the dishes, after an hour, they came to inform us that an accident had happened and that it would take even longer. We were given a cover charge to alleviate hunger. When the dishes arrived, some were cold, others overdone (the risotto looked like a paste). The price of the dishes is quite salty and it is not worth the food or experience by far.\n",
      "Good choice of Chinese restaurant. The breaded chicken and the Yakimesh risotto are very good. The service is reasonable. I recommend\n",
      "We were very well received and well attended by the friendly Danilo. food was wonderful, well served and fair price. Great place for romantic dinner.\n",
      "The kind of place that works well for both a business lunch and a dinner for two ... the atmosphere is very pleasant, good wine list, tasty food and good service. The 'work as a whole' is worth the price. I really like it and recommend it.\n",
      "A good option for those who want to eat meat other than on a rotating basis. The cuts are of good meat, with quality. Special highlight for the sirloin with Parmesan cheese! The service time is fast and friendly!\n",
      "I was drawn to dinner by the environment. The pizzeria was packed, and after we arrived it packed even more ... There was only one waiter, who despite being visibly flustered by the situation, served us well. We opted for Calzone, and we were very surprised by the flavor !! The dough is sensational. The price is below average for the region, and the quality above average. I really want to go back there! It is a tip for the owners to reinforce the team on weekends.\n",

      "Lunch at Spettus de Boa Viagem is the only one in the state that offers Lobster carvery ... The value is not the cheapest, but it is worth every penny of the R $ 109.00 that is paid per person! It also pays to pan for those collective shopping promotions that often go out on the net to enjoy even more without paying so much. Spectacular service, very clean environment. Only in the bathroom there was no mouthwash available ... but there is! The variety of refined foods are to be envied! I recommend!\n",
      "For many years the Sorveteria Tropical was the only choice of artisanal ice cream in the city and perhaps that is why it has stagnated so much. For those who want to taste the regional flavors like pine cone, mangaba, cajá or sapodilla, it is worth knowing, but the service is terrible and the ice cream ball is very small. The facilities of the two ice cream parlors (Prudente and Lagoa Nova) are well outdated and sometimes, inexplicably, are closed. With the competition of good gelaterias in Natal, Tropical needs to get out of the doldrums and modernize, offering more comfort, better service and new flavors for customers.\n",
      "Beautiful location with a varied menu with economical options, it is not a cutting-edge gastronomy place but makes up for it with professional and fast service and a wonderful wine list for the options and varied price offer\n",

      "Serviced by Ricardo and Viana. Excellent service, attentive and helpful, always ready. Thanks for listening\n",
      "Although the menu was quite lacking the day we went (the first four items we ordered didn't have), the other choices were excellent. The wine list is very lean but they helped us choose a wine that harmonized with the meal and was one of the cheapest on the menu. Restaurant to return and taste the other dishes. Delicious.\n",
      "It is a great option for those who like meat. The atmosphere is wonderful, the service is great and the food is excellent. We were very pleased with everything on site. The meat came as we ordered and the accompanying portion served two people well. The price is reasonable. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "I am demanding in terms of quality and service in restaurants. I can say that Osteria Mattiazzi is impeccable. The details that make a dinner a truly unforgettable experience, in every way. From the meticulous service to the presentation and balance of the dishes, including an excellent wine list. The owner is Italian and a deep connoisseur of native cuisine, as well as an enthusiastic lover of wines from Italy and elsewhere. I recommend it with all the emphasis and joy.\n",
      "Eataly is a great place, with three good restaurants, one for meat, another for fish, and one for pasta. There you can find several Italian products for sale. It's worth the visit.\n",
      "As you can see, I like the restaurant very much, both the environment and what is served, and this time the visit had no setbacks!Despite the same menu, the lunch system differs from that of dinner, because in the afternoon the choice is for a meat / protein with a garnish and the salad buffet, paying the price of the meat / protein; at night the value for the same sequence is fixed.The salad buffet is very varied and presented, can be eaten separately for a lower price and has two proteins: shredded chicken and kani.On Sundays and holidays at night, for a fixed price (99 reais) are included the salad buffet, the cover charge (breads), a meat / protein and the dessert buffet!The experience for those who like meat without being a steakhouse is very valid!\n",

      "Japanese cuisine with a lot of quality, creative, beautiful and tasty dishes! I have already eaten in several chain restaurants, but I mainly recommend the so-called different Manekinekos, such as Leblon and Casa Shopping, in Barra.

      "I bought a combined promotion for urban fish, all right, the price really was suspicious, 29.90. I bought 2, getting there I realized that the place was very ugly. Very high light, the chairs were untidy, off the tables. Detail, the restaurant opened at 18:30 and I arrived at 19:00. Well, I ordered the combo, it came and the face was no longer very good, those fish were not fresh at all and the pieces were very small. To make matters worse, the employees started arguing out loud, for everyone to hear. We ate and saw that the taste was no longer there, when we ordered the second, I watched the sushiman prepare and while he prepared he talked to a boy who was outside the counter. I already died of disgust there, because I imagined his saliva falling in my food. When I ate the shrimp niguiri, I had to retch! Then came dessert, a ball of PASTE ice cream, very sweet and in a very ugly aluminum bowl. Anyway, I'll never be back for free!\n",
      "It is undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Kilo de Roraima and has been improving every day, I hope it will continue to improve and correct some minor flaws.\n",
      "We were driven by a desire to eat pork knee and went to the O Alemão restaurant.My husband and eldest son love German cuisine.There is an indoor environment with air conditioning, and larger tables for families.They loved the food (pork knee) and wheat beer.I ordered a salmon which was also very good.But the difference was the service. Very kind. The waiter who served us was very friendly. This anywhere in the world makes a difference, but in Fortaleza it becomes a differentiator.\n",
      "Being well received and having the best caipirinha are just details of this bar. Eat: coxinha with pepper sauce, porpeta with dark mustard and steak tartar that besides delicious comes with a super show in the preparation.\n",
      "Cool and cozy atmosphere !!The house drink, Rinofresh mix of rum, mandarin, mint, is interesting and delicious!The dough comes on point, excellent!The portion comes nothing measured, little for those who like substance, lolGood service!The price is above average, so it is served!\n",
      "Favorable place to enjoy a late afternoon with friends, very well frequented, only if arriving after 19: 00h is difficult to get tables.\n",
      "Great place to drink with friends on Tuesdays, having a Tuesdays promotion accompanied by live music, maybe if I didn't play only country people it would be more inviting!\n",
      "Excellent food and service! We went on the first day and made sure to come back before the trip back home. The only point is the waiting line, so it is good to plan to arrive before 7:30 pm.\n",
      "Delicious food, waiting time corresponded with the time informed by the waiter, dish presented with refinement, excellent service, very good music, in short: I recommend it and I will be back more often! Those who come to Maceió cannot stop by.\n",

Piña colada the best I tried in Manaus, keep it up, don't let the pattern drop, it's great.\n",

      "The food is very delicious but the highlight is the service, we were attended by the luzicleide and marinaldo both are very helpful and attentive. Nice place and music, worth the trip. The only point of improvement is that we ordered the shrimp stuffed with catupiry, even though they used a tasty curd, it was not catupiry.\n",

      "I'm suspicious to evaluate, being an egg-loving person, but come on ...The restaurant is super charming, the burger is great, super well served, juicy meat and of course an accompanying fried egg. Iced tea is a great choice. I die of curiosity to try the bolovo!Prices are fair, correct service, great option for egg lovers!\n",
      "Nice place, with good food, however, the lack of space between tables, making access by waiters difficult! Great Fried Whole Tilapia; I recommend!\n",
      "Cozy place with wonderful food and we were very well attended by waiter Felipe and his team ..\n",

      "I was at Tanit with my boyfriend and a couple of friends for dinner. We went on a Friday and the movement was intense, we had a reasonable wait (which was extended thanks to a customer who changed tables on his own and hindered the hostess' dynamics ...) but nothing much out of the reality of São Paulo . The hostess handled the situation well, even offering us a delicious appetizer as a courtesy (Croquetas de Leek with Goat Cheese). My choice was Peixe do Dia, it was very tasty, but I kept an eye on my friend's dish (Arroz del Mar), which seemed even more appetizing than mine. For dessert I chose Coulant, which is a 70% Belgian chocolate souffle served with tonka bean ice cream (I have no idea what tonka is, but the taste is smooth, similar to the cream, and the combination with the souffle was divine It would only increase the amount of ice cream served a little, to last as long as the souffle, which comes in a bowl enough for the couple.\n",
      "We went to Santana, a pleasant atmosphere, several tables, it was not very crowded, it was a Tuesday, efficient service, fresh fish, variety of shishis, I just thought there could be more variety of shashimis, there was only salmon and white fish, example. But I'll be back.\n",
      "I like it a lot, it has a good price and the food is very good. Homemade food with a little gourmet touch! Worth it! What is boring is the rush hour queue. Nobody deserve!\n",
      "I made another attempt and once again I was disappointed. The standard of the house dropped a lot. The meats had a characteristic flavor of being in smoke for a long time. Hard meats, with little flavor and unattractive appearance for a barbecue lover. The service was much to be desired, especially by some responsible for cutting the meat. The night only had a pleasant ending due to the perfect papaya cream.\n",
      "I know and appreciate Arab food since I was very young. My grandmother cooked divinely.I have rarely tasted such striking and harmonic flavors away from home! The atmosphere is familiar and bright. The new space was incredible. I frequent and recommend! ❤️Congratulations. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\n",

      "Restaurant in a condominium away from the center. Good decoration and great service. I waited a little longer for number 1 in the city. We tried the 9-step tasting menu. The dishes are small but at the end of 9 you cannot go hungry. Highlight is the fillet with butter cheese and mill honey. The file was fantastic. The other dishes were ok.\n",
      "A very cozy restaurant, with very polite waiters. The food has a great presentation and is very delicious. The value of the dish is on average 65 reais, something that corresponds with the quality. But the best of the place is the beautiful view of the Amazonas theater. The only thing I could complain about was that on the day the air conditioning was in trouble and that made the room a little hot. I intend to return more often.\n",
      "This restaurant is sensational. Meals very well served and with good service. Wine list with plenty of options. Fair price. worth the cost benefit.\n",

      "Wonderful place, price for all pockets, very big place, super delicious food. I highly recommend it. I want to go back!\n",
      "Only eat at this place if you don't have anywhere else to eat. The food is pretty average, but you can eat. If you've ever eaten in good quality Japanese, you'll find the place a bad one. Sushi that are sold at the freedom fair are better.\n"

      "It is not a big space, nor very comfortable (it’s kind of warm), but the products are very interesting.It has typical juices (such as cupuaçu and bacuri), in addition to the tasty patola (it is like a chicken drumstick, but it is filled with crab meat).\n",

I have several friends who do the same. For dessert, milk pudding or custard tart. Ah, the customer takes the sympathy of the owner Ana, the owner!\n",
      "Initially we were already surprised by the impeccable service of João, a smiling, kind, polite and very knowledgeable young man about all the information on the menu, solving all our doubts with mastery !!!! The pizza was another pleasant surprise, WONDERFUL! Explosion of flavor! We will definitely be back at the house when we return to Curitiba! Congratulations!!!\n",

      "I found a good place to make a good snack, good, simple, cheap and fast food, first class service.\n",
      "Without being slutty, I've never eaten anything as dishonest as this pizza. This proves how much people or the mass does not know how to eat. Pasta looks like a cream cracker, I stuffed it without undercooked balance and without sauce. In short, inadmissible. The images speak for themselves.\n",
      "The environment, practically every day it opens, is full. So, try to go up to 21 hours at the most, if you don't want to stand, waiting for the table to clear. The food is good. The beer is good too, and the service is good. And there is live music, usually MPB. There are also televisions that broadcast football matches and fights.\n",
      "Relaxed atmosphere, famous pies and nice people having a beer after work. Good service and the main thing: they serve the black brahma draft beer! The menu of snacks and drinks is quite varied. Appetizer prices are a little bit salty, but in general Belmonte has a good cost-benefit ratio.\n",

There is no cover charge and no 10% tip is charged.Staying inside the bar can be a challenge because it is very hot, so try to go with light clothes anyway.

Today, to our surprise, we did it at first and it was worth it to have gone. The first-rate food. A delicious burrata and then a parmegiana file that was excellent. But the main thing was not the location, which was very beautiful, nor the food was very tasty, but the service provided by Garçon Jarcem (it is not written that way). From the beginning, attentive and concerned with serving us properly, guiding us to ask for what is necessary. A family that was close to us caught my attention, very indecisive and at no time did he lose his patience or attention. Instead. The entire time he answered the questions carefully and always guided in the best possible way. It really does make a difference. Congratulations !!! We will be back and I highly recommend it.\n",

I ordered a cheese fondue and it tasted like burnt. The location is not good, difficult to reach if you don't look on the map first.Apart from that first impression, the place is very pleasant, beautiful and romantic.\n",

      "Obey the franchise rules well.Very clean and pleasant atmosphere, very good service, except in the waiting room.We waited about 40 minutes to get in, and made some orders that were only delivered when we were already at the table.The beer is very good, but I found it expensive!I recommend ordering the traditional pork ribs (ribs on the barbie) with mashed potatoes.The puree is divine.The famous onion (Bloomin Onion) is not all that. I found it oily and spent the whole day packed, just like everyone who ate.I find the prices very expensive for what they offer.Overall it's very good, it's worth it. I recommend.\n",

The service at the Sushi Bar (counter) was reasonable. I confess that we were disappointed and that when we return to São Paulo we will definitely go to Jam Jardins, as we opted for Itaim because we were staying closer to this unit. The waiters were concerned and only serving full tables (certainly concerned with tips and 10% services, including the waiter brought us the note there including the 10% and told us to remove it (he didn't like it) but we didn't get a good one service and yes it comes bad.

I see it as positive that there is no dispersive (or less waste), as negative that you are always interrupted and not always comfortable to serve what you want and in the amount you want.\n",

They have a very diversified menu where you can get quite indecisive when choosing, but it is sure that you will eat well. Ever. The inernacional shrimp is fantastic, the great pizzas, the fish, meat, desserts and the famous caipiroscas tb also do not disappoint. I highly recommend it to anyone who comes to visit Fortaleza. Another attraction is dishes for up to four people, with a great cost benefit. Very good parlevas the children also, because they offer a super complete playground to let the children.\n",

The price reflects this and you can get a good meal without feeling like you have been robbed.I was with a friend of mine and the portions here are so big, we have left loads, which was shameful, since it is good, but I couldn't eat more.

      "The environment is very beautiful and the view is wonderful. However the service left something to be desired and the dishes were out of point. The presentation was beautiful but the fish came dry and the shrimp was rubbery. If the goal is to be in a beautiful environment with a beautiful view ok. But the kitchen needs urgent adjustments!\n",

Unfortunately, they charge 40 reais only for entry (man).Every time I went, it was on a special occasion, like a birthday. Other than that, I will not go under any circumstances. There are some bars in Tatuapé with the same climate, for a much higher cost-benefit ratio. I recommend it to anyone who wants to know a quality Irish Pub, but get ready to leave your pants on, going to a bar in Tatuapé, but paying as in Itaim Bibi.\n",

      "Super well served, great drinks and food very well served, waiters all attentive, especially Charles, very polite, I recommend the visit.\n",
      "We ordered a dish called Papa de Jerimum. The big and tasty prawns are served inside a jerimum (pumpkin) accompanied by rice with broccoli and fried manioc. The cassava is processed and fried, I confess I didn't like the cassava very much. It is a tip for you to ask to switch to the traditional one. But that did not hinder the visit to Cameroon. Impeccable service and the food is sooo worth it. For two people, we ordered a plate, a juice and a drink and everything was R $ 129.00. Congratulations to all the restaurant staff.\n",
      "The house is great. The atmosphere is small but very welcoming. The flagship is the spaghetti made in the melted cheese. Search on (Instagram videos) that is sensational. At the time of preparation, the cooks invite you to watch and they also give you a lesson on the preparation, it's really cool. Ask early to watch the preparation. There are beers and wines to accompany. The dish is very well served. If you are celiac or just want a gluten-free food, inform the waiter as they prepare a specific gluten-free pasta (at no extra cost). The service was great. The only caveat is that each is not accessible. I recommend it and we will return.\n",

      "There are few places in Porto Alegre where it is possible to gather so many attributes. It all starts with a calm and measured ambience of the possible silence (it is recommended to speak quietly in the establishment).It has a menu very different from the traditional ones, where all the boldness of the cheff materializes in the form of pizza.The drinks menu, certainly does not leave anyone in the hand, has selections of special beers, good wine list and service as good as the other services.My suggestion: Be sure to try the garlic pizza with ginger, let alone the Triba sweet !! (fantastic)\n",
      "Excellent beach hut, nice and family atmosphere. Crab on Thursday night excellent. In front of the tent there is a crepe stand, I love the chocolate there.\n",
      "Expensive and tight. We don't understand why he is so famous. There are better and more dignified places in the city.\n",
      "We went with friends to get to know the service, good at the entrance they serve very tasty rissoles so you can imagine that the service will be excellent.The service is self-serving, the waiters bring the meat after all, it is a steakhouse and they bring polenta, fried manioc etc., but detail the waitress who served these delicacies treated us with (ooooooo, want it or not) after all we are her clients or employee, because neither employed is like that. Well after that discomfort they still wanted us to pay 10%, just kidding and there was still questioning. We are not obliged to pay the 10% mainly if we were treated badly. The manager stayed on the fence. The food is very good, but the service is bad.\n",
      "Otto's shrimp festival was a disappointment as the least shrimp in the dishes.From the entrance to the last dish, there is almost no shrimp, so much so that I rejected the second dish, pasta with shrimp, and asked the manager to prepare new dishes and actually bring shrimp.The dishes were changed and in fact were better. The last dish also came relatively well done but the repetition of rice with shrimp right after pasta with shrimp turned out to be unattractive.I suggested to the manager to change the dishes because two dishes are served with rice and one with pasta, none with salad or vegetables.The sequence offered is:shrimp broth, shrimp roulade, shrimp broccoli rice, white shrimp sauce pasta, white shrimp rice.The service is very good, waiters and manager very helpful. The place is small but the air conditioning is old, dirty, and drips on the tables, which was our case, after complaining they changed tables.\n",

      "The executive menu is wonderful, taste unmatched with sophisticated drinks and atmosphere! I will be back for sure!\n",
      "When you feel like eating different meat, with excellent flavor, Sujinho is the option. The traditional bisseta has unparalleled flavor and is served at the point desired by the customer. While waiting for the thorough preparation of this delicacy, nothing like the sliced ​​onion with a fresh roll. Very good.There are other options and also many good and well served, such as feijoada, with excellent flavor.\n",

      "Quiet place with different hours. Large, with satisfactory service and parking space.\n",

      "Temaki well done with the crunchy Nori. Everything fresh and tasty. Various flavors. Simple environment, however, for a stop to kill your hunger is very reasonable.\n",
      "Staff totally unprepared. Bad service, rude waiters, poorly made drinks. Quite different from the São Paulo unit. I do not recommend!\n",
      "Very crowded restaurant, but worth the wait.The strongest on the menu are the duck dishes, but I ordered a meat and it was excellent.Differentiated service and very pleasant environment!The only drawback is a 12% fee.\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, very good service. Sandwiches very similar to Subway, very good salad and Juices are excellent.\n",
      "I was in Belém that month and I scheduled to meet some friends at Tomaz to meet again. When I arrived I went to the counter and said that I needed approximately 10 places to accommodate friends, the attendants paid little attention and pointed the place for me to stay, I felt bad, after all there are almost 10 people! I was not well served and I decided to separate the tables and choose the place to sit, the order took a long time and in the end we had to insert a request from a friend in the account, we requested the correction and we were given a separate account of the value of the dish.I believe that the night could start much better and the reception could be a grade 10! Not because I take a lot of people, but because of the pleasure of serving!Focusing on quality service training for the teams I believe is a great differentiator, the art of service needs to be taught and practiced by organizations!Thanks.\n",
      "The cover charge is delicious, the dishes are very beautiful, but the portions are not very large. I suggest the parmesan risotto. And be sure to try the butter and bread from the cover. The service is also great,\n",
      "I really liked the place, from the menu to the service, not to mention the quality of the snack. My suggestion is the black burger with black bread and mushrooms, sensational. Point of improvement would be the options of imported beers.\n",
      "The food took a long time and came in parts. It is not able to deliver simple appetizers! Also an insect was found in the children's play area and the score was so wrong we will be back.\n",
      "One of the best restaurants in Natal in general and certainly the best of Minas food.In addition to the flavors, careful preparation, a very pleasant atmosphere and the prose with the house staff is always good.\n",
      "In summary:Poorly served, to the point of serving the dish to another tableBadly taken draft beerExpensive beerMusic: funk from midnight until it's over.The public is cool, but they will soon migrate to other, much better places.\n",
      "Impeccable service! The dishes were sensational !!! We ordered the truffled Lazanha and Tuna with manioc crust ... Wonderful !!! we had dinner at the best restaurants in Jampa, but by far, this was the best !!! Super recommend!\n",
      "I'm from JP and we got to know you for many compliments! Family of 4! Entrance pastries and tapioca dices very good! Main dishes: spaghetti carbonara, Argentinian picanha, lamb trolley, ribs in honey! At least all good. My daughter found the rib on the outback better!Price of wines very reasonable, the menu is not the most extensive, I had a very reasonable Italian price on the website of Grandcru 70, there 110.I'll be back to try other dishes for sure.\n",
      "I think this place is amazing. The meats are great, there is not a wide variety, but the quality of what is served is very, very, good. The price of a complete meal with about two beers, starter, main course, liquor, coffee and dessert for two is approx. R $ 350.00. It's not for every pocket, but it's worth it.\n",
      "One of the best restaurants in town, for those who love a good barbecue of great quality. The dishes are excellent and the prices are well suited to what is offered. Great atmosphere for lunch, dinner or happy hour to be with friends or something more romantic. The service from the waiters is satisfactory. Because it is a popular place, it can be difficult to get a parking space depending on the time. But it's worth it for its great cuisine.\n",
      "We had several references about the restaurant, and getting there left nothing to be desired. Very good starters, and a wide variety of dishes. Good service and nice place, I had a rental car, but if you don't have a car they have a shuttle service, very good! Worth the experience!\n",
      "Great salty pizzas, the sweets leave something to be desired, some seem semi raw and the service is terrible. The 3 times I went I waited a long time for pizza.\n",
      "There was a misconception, and correcting my assessment, that it was wrongly placed for Pizzaria 1900 in R.G. From north. Corrected thus: It was for the 1st. time we went to dinner at Pizzaria 1900 in Tatuapé. We were in a group of 15 adults. We believed it was the same pattern as the Vila Mariana Headquarters (State of Israel), but it was not what we found. As we like it, my wife and I, for raw garlic pizza, we always order Transylvania, which at V. Mariana is spicy. Here in Tatuapé, there was no garlic, and it was not the same. Other people in the group ordered other flavors, such as calabreza, shimeji, victorian and brocolis. The service was good, but at the time of the bill, we paid and soon the waiter came saying that there was a mistake and we had to charge some drinks and service fee, which we had already authorized to charge. When you receive the bill, still printed by computer, you believe that everything is fine. Anyway, the error was legitimate. We still prefer 1900 from Vila Mariana.\n",
      "The restaurant offers sophisticated and interesting exotic dishes that innovate the flavor of Japanese cuisine!The pieces are very tasty, different experience!Good wine list and good drink optionsExcellence in service!The amazing dessert of green tea and red fruits I recommend!I also recommend tasting the chef's menu or you can taste the main dishes of the house, with 5 steps!O\n",
      "Restaurant with excellent sea views, pleasant atmosphere, air-conditioned, with good food and fair prices.\n",
      "I went to Patorroco on the recommendation of a local, and it was very worth it. Saturday night, bar packed with locals, snacks coming out of the kitchen over and over. The service is very good, a place to eat and drink well.\n",
      "Super nice setting for a lunch with friends, the menu has many American food options. I tasted the famous hibb's and wings and I really liked the flavor!Ahh, the price of the meals is great too hahaha\n",
      "Returning to the place, only this time for dinner, a surprise to find that the various salad buffet only works for lunch ... we went with a la carte options. Only compliments to the chosen options (ancho, flank 🥩). Less good waiter service. I will return\n"

      "We went to this restaurant on my husband's birthday in March this year.The restaurant itself is impeccable! In all senses. The service is outstanding and the food is fantastic. The dishes are very well served, three people eat a dish well. And taking that into account it doesn't even come as expensive as some say. We think that the prices are very fair.The cod shell (crab shell style, but made of cod) is sensational, and the fried cod skin that they offer as a courtesy takes away a wonderful flavor. We don't even have anything to say about the dishes. The best cod we have ever eaten in Vitória was certainly in the fireplace.Parking is complicated, but they have valet service, but we took a taxi because we took a bottle of wine.As it was my husband's birthday, we took a cake to sing congratulations and they were very receptive and took care of our cake and at the time of congratulations they even provided a candle, as I had forgotten.About our wine, in the fireplace they do not charge a cork (fee that restaurants normally charge to take your own wine) and even then the waiter opens your bottle, puts the wine in a decanter to breathe and serves ... that the restaurant won a lot of points for us. In most restaurants they turn up their noses when you take your wine even though they charge a fee. Their wine list is very good, but as we didn't know it and it was a special date, my husband wanted to take a special wine that we bought on a trip.For me it's worth the visit.\n",
      "From the succulence of the hamburger to the taste of artisanal sauces and cheeses (and wonderful artisanal milkshakes), there is no doubt: the best hamburger in Salvador. Comfortable and well decorated, it is the perfect place for casual lunches and dinners. However, despite all these qualities, the most remarkable thing about the experience of going to Cazolla is getting to know the team. From the waiters to the owners, the effort to offer the best possible service to customers is visible.After a few trips, don't be surprised if you've already memorized the name of the entire team.Congratulations to the Cazolla team!\n",
      "We went the 1st time to try the hamburger and since then we always come back!Yesterday I ordered the pumpkin risotto with dried meat and it was just divine !!With a vast menu of craft beers to accompany the great food options, remember to save space for dessert, because they are wonderful. The Dairy Petit Gateau in particular closes the experience on site with a golden key.\n",
      "Barnabé empadinha is always a great option! Very polite staff wherever you go, delicious and super affordable value.\n",
      "The food is just excellent! The atmosphere is refined and very pleasant. The waiters are attentive.The price is quite affordable, a shrimp dish, which generously serves 3 people, costs an average of R $ 120.We were in a group of 7 people. When we arrived at the restaurant we were told that we would have to wait around 30 minutes, however in less than 10 minutes we were already seated at a table.\n",
      "Very show tent, worth every penny spent there! Good food, good music, swimming pool always with beautiful people and good attendants!\n",

      "I've eaten a few times at Suk, but unfortunately they took the spinach savory off the menu. The falafel kebab is very tasty.\n",
      "From the valet service, even the food is perfect. Dishes that come out of the doldrums of traditional cuisine. Signed by those who understand and super tasty.\n",
      "The restaurant has a very simple lounge, there is a lot of confusion, there is a lot of talk, but the coolest thing is this whole mixture, combined with delicious food. The dishes are made and served with very fresh ingredients and are very tasty. The only thing I didn't really like was the dessert. I ordered an Arab sweet and it was not very good. Regarding the service, it leaves something to be desired.\n",
      "Traditional Indian restaurant, simple but very well decorated, very cute theme. Delicious food and really Indian staff, barely speak Portuguese.\n",
      "We left from a distance and from other states in a group of 20 people to have fun .. If you don't mind wrong orders and bees or hair like the pititinga we ask for here is the ideal place!\n",
      "Couvert courtesy of mini cheese bread, artisanal sausage and crackling (perfect, crispy and dry). Executive dishes ranging from $ 20.00 to $ 25.00 and buffet at will for $ 45 / person with typical Minas Gerais food and desserts (highlighting ambrosia)\n",

      "Great location, a wide variety of pizza flavors, the service is fast and pleasant and best of all, the price is right.\n",
      "Pleasant environment . It has variety of food. The service is fast and organized. Sometimes there is a queue. The price is high, but the food is quality.\n",
      "Incredible place, several halls with different types of music and shows, for all tastes. Get there early to face a short queue.\n",
      "The best hamburger in Poa, all in the best gaucho style. Note 10 environment too. The price has always been just above what it could be.\n",
      "There are several restaurants around the city, including Shopping Curitiba, and they are famous for their delicious hamburgers. But they also have the famous ribs with barbecue sauce, various salads and a heart of barbecue as a starter. The kids love it.\n",
      "Wonderful atmosphere, very good service, the food was very good, but at the restaurant level my wife and I expected more, despite having better places, I still recommend it and it just wasn't with a high score because I think the pasta can be improved due the amount charged.\n",
      "Restaurant with typical and regional foods with excellent service and a la carte or self service. I recommend\n",
      "The flavors and art are well located and the food is simple and delicious, the prices are very good and the service was great I recommend.\n",

      "Excellent hamburger, with a comfortable atmosphere and good service. The meat is juicy and to the point, plenty of bacon and the difference is the freshly melted cheese. I recommend knowing and trying the Ray that leaves them.\n",
      "Very attentive waiters and receptionists, very pleasant atmosphere, lounge style, but ideal for going with both family and friends. I was in doubt between one of the dishes (which takes banana puree, which I personally recommend because it has a unique flavor), and the waiter brought me some to taste before placing the order. The dishes with shrimp and caipirinhas are a great option to order. With a DJ music in a pleasant and tasteful volume, it makes the atmosphere very relaxing, which matches the look of the beach.\n"

There was a long line, perhaps because it was Saturday, but we were soon served, because the employees were organizing all the service. The draft beer was cold and tasty. There are several options on the menu, however, our choice was the codfish pastry. I recommend.\n",
      "Located inside the Saraiva bookshop of Shopping Riomar. This time we decided to try the hamburger provided by the house. The fries are great, the sandwich is good. It would have been much better if it had come to the point, because the meat was dry.\n",
      "I've been to parties there and I'm not going to lie that I love it! I get tired of the pizzas that are delicious. You can go without fear of being happy.\n",
      "For those who seek and like fried fish, Bambino is an indispensable visit. Dry and tasty fish, it is also served shrimp on the breath (I don't particularly eat, but those who eat approve). Simple and always full place, food takes between 30 and 45 minutes to be served. I recommend.\n",
      "Very good restaurant, with excellent food and top service. Waiter Reis was very friendly and attentive, introduced me to the sommelier who made an excellent wine suggestion, the manager went to the table to introduce himself and was extremely friendly.

      "We went to dinner in the restaurant, very busy, we had to wait for a table for dinner. It has buffet per kg and tapioca menu. The only thing I didn’t like was that there were no signs indicating all the dishes, I had to call a waiter to ask.\n",
      "I was extremely poorly attended by the meter trainee. I complained about my plate, the meat came spoiled, it stank so much that the table next to it felt and asked if it was fish. The restaurant limited itself to saying that it was in the standard and that it was cut Thursday, they did not reverse or replace the dish. The cook was summoned, acknowledged the mistake, apologized and even so the Trainee, who should not be representing the company, refused to take any action and kept looking with a mocking face.\n",
      "It works like this: you arrive in a class of three and are well attended by someone who understands to be the owner. He smiles, takes the order and says that the next table is his. OK. It is the established model anywhere. Five minutes pass, a group of four regulars arrive, hug the owner, go to the kitchen door, talk, laugh and go upstairs to lunch. Row? Wait? For what? They are friends of the owner. So support the restaurant. I went to another.\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, kind staff, tasty food. Note if the customer is going to use a discount coupon because the hours are different, which I think is absurd.\n",
      "The atmosphere is cozy, with a different decoration. Remember the bars in Europe. A different place! We ordered the octopus and a shrimp that were great, as well as tasting good beers and good drinks.\n",
      "It seems more focused on delivery. The atmosphere is small and not very inviting. The service is just reasonable. The food is good, but it doesn't stand out. A pity, we expected more.\n"

      "I went to the restaurant very early. I arrived before opening on a Monday. I didn't get in line, of course. But even with the restaurant empty, the service is not friendly. Comparing (I love comparing), there is no one to make you special that has Outback, for example. The snack is more or less. The black bread is just beautiful, but I found it dry. The cheddar is hairy, I didn't like it. Do you know when you leave with that impression that Mc Donald's snack is better? It's the price? Absurd of expensive. Not really.Other than that, we are on vacation and the characters do not appear, only at night (sometimes) or on weekends. Swear? It's a vacation! The restaurant was full of children. I met, beauty. I killed curiosity. But I am not coming back, neither for the service, nor for the decoration, nor for the snack and much less for the price. I spent R $ 200 (two adults, a 7-year-old child and a 5-year-old, without even asking for dessert) and the worst, I left with the impression that Mc's cheddar is more delicious ... afe.\n",
      "Very good restaurant. Climatized environment. It manages to have a good service, even being immense and always crowded. Good food, great variety of salads and desserts. Price according to what is offered. Free teas, coffee and liquor. Small parking, for the size of the restaurant, which gets in the way a little, as parking on Av Jaguarari is not allowed. I recommend arriving early, to avoid the stress of trying to park and fail.\n",

      "I love Bibi (I go to all of them). For me the best place to drink top quality natural juice, wonderful crepes, you assemble your salad and also the best Açaí in Rio de Janeiro. , but it is a restaurant focused on healthy eating. The environment is super pleasant, super clean. The service leaves a little to be desired on weekends as elsewhere, so it is not really a problem. , it really is high but in my opinion consistent with the quality, so it's worth it. I love Bibi!My favorite juices:-Blackberry-Cop with poop water.\n",

From the outside, we saw that there was no singer at the place or a dj and when the bill arrived it was a surprise ... they charged dj. And what they called a dj was just the sound playing, someone put a song on the sound that was there playing and charged us for it. We asked the waiter if we should pay for it, and he confirmed it.

Against the place I only have the issue of being very crowded on weekends and the location is difficult for those who do not know the city. Every tourist should know Ordones!\n",

It was only after getting my (reserved) table that it was possible to order anything.2 - to my surprise, as soon as I sat down at the table, the waiter wanted to force me to order the entrée is a main course, claiming that the kitchen was full and couldn't wait to order things separately. It is evident that the restaurant wants to have turnover, but at this point, the base of pressure.

      "I always have lunch at Verde Vale at the Tres Americas shoping. There are several salads and very tasty hot dishes. Decorated and pleasant environment. I recommend.\n",
      "Great service, delicious food, the dishes for 03 serve quietly 04 people, and the dishes for 05 serve up to 07. Very cold beer.\n",
      "2 Wednesdays in the month, Bistrot Bella Gourmet organizes the Degustation Menu, a true gastronomic trip. The menu consists of 8 dishes including dessert. The dishes are very tasty and the presentation is incredible. Participation is subject to reservation.\n",
      "Small restaurant. The buffet is arranged in a strange and tight way. There are some food options, but none of them looked really tasty. We were in a large group of about 15 people and our reservation was in a tight corner of the restaurant, we were very poorly installed.\n",
      "The food is good, it has several options to please the general public, but the service leaves a little to be desired.\n",
      "Was it against sense? Unfortunately not. You can see another evaluation of mine about the same restaurant, which I have known for over 6 years, about its excellent food and service. Today, July 6, I had the worst experience with the place. EVERYTHING TO BE CRITICIZED: dirty table, lack of attention and courtesy, tasteless food, expensive price, due to the poor quality of the food (I didn’t eat worse meat), terrible service, lack of interest from the waiters to the manager, in short, nothing was worth it . I left the house with the best expectation of returning to one of my favorite restaurants in Natal and I don't know when I'll be back again. I had planned to visit the Brasilia unit. I'll rethink.\n",
      "Place with creative decor. Little. It doesn't have much variety and the food goes from good to bland, it depends on the dish and the day. The price is good for self-service, but drinks are expensive.\n",
      "I really liked the dishes, I ate a chicken and loved it, the wonderful desserts, I recommend, I will come back every time I come to Rio ...The view thought it would be better.\n",
      "I went to the restaurant with a group of friends. Made the orders all in the sametime and etc. When the waiter brought the dishes, he found that one of the dishes was missing (1 of 3 dishes). He went, asked, spoke to the manager. I called the manager, talked and always another 10 minutes. Everyone ate cold food, except for those without the plate that left hungry. 40 minutes after the first dishes are served, I close my account and leave hungry. With the consent and support of the manager, who sent the full bill and only took the dish that didn't come because we complained.Absurd.Lack of professionalism.Lack of respect for the customer\n",
      "Very good food, quality of the fish and temaki with nori that breaks easily in the mouth, I recommend the ceviche and the white fish .. apart from the hot and fried dishes that are very good! one thing I was unhappy about was the service .. we ordered the rodizio menu about 3 times and nothing came .. we ordered a missing chopstick and it didn't come (I had to pick it up from an empty table), I ordered a flavor dessert and it other..Average price of Japanese restaurants in sp ..Another thing is that the bathroom is at the top of the restaurant .. making it difficult for the disabled and elderly .. and being divided into 3 doors in the same place .. a little uncomfortable for some people ..But I recommend it anyway\n",
      "Beautiful restaurant, cozy atmosphere in the middle of a wooded garden. Varied menu with great wine options and delicious desserts.\n",
      "It is worth visiting and buying fresh fish and seafood and even tasting them on the spot. Pack the frozen goods for travel. And the prices are great.\n",
      "The room is spacious, clean, full of granite on the floor and on the tables, but the advantages stop there. Parking is difficult and far, the service does not compromise, but it is a little weird, the snacks are tasteless, a breaded potato is served as rustic. The prices are exorbitant for what it offers. For the same price you can eat in better places ...\n",
      "Perfect option for a la carte meats, air-conditioned environment and with a very varied menu, the place has a warm, calm atmosphere and with a piano played live, which leaves a perfect atmosphere, everything very comfortable, satisfying dishes and very cold beers, mr. Freire (Maîte), is an excellent professional, he remembered me, I am from São Paulo and had not visited him for 1 year, it was gratifying to see him again, the waiter Mário attended me very well, this time I went 3 times for dinner . For me, it is one of the best places in Fortaleza, it’s the 6th time I’ve been and I don’t miss visiting them, I certainly recommend, grade 10.\n",
      "Lively canteenFantastic pastaBeautiful and cozy placeGreat for celebrating birthdaysGood winesGood cost benefit\n",
      "The store is not as big and does not have all the options as in Europe but you will find much more than the GRU duty free. for those who like the brand it's worth it.\n",
      "The atmosphere is sophisticated and extremely pleasant, the service first and the pizza very attractive. In addition to pizza they serve lunch at a price compatible with the environment but without overdoing it. In summary, a pleasant atmosphere, good service and food.\n",
      "Very tasty and well made food, generous dishes, very attentive service from the owners and pleasant atmosphere.\n",
      "Very good location, structure, atmosphere and service!The menu, quite varied.I highlight the super traditional Couvert that cannot be missed!\n",
      "I didn't think the restaurant was as big as it is. Lol Great to go with friends. Intimate decoration to compensate for the spaciousness of the space.The menu is huge, with many options and the dishes are not individual: they serve 2 to 3 people (this could be better explained, even to justify the prices we read on the menu and not to create confusion and exaggeration in orders.)The presentation of the dishes is great, an interesting standard for a restaurant of this size, where something more busy is expected.I ate a salmon at the right spot.The entrance was great and the drinks are very good.Friendly, competent waiters who have had their work visibly hampered by the computerized ordering system. A restaurant with such a volume of customers cannot have a few registration terminals as is the case there. The waiters lined up 4, 5 at the terminal in the hall where I was. They don't deserve that kind of stress at work. Improve your situation q the service will improve together.\n",
      "I loved the pizzas, pastas, everything they serve is quality! It is certainly the best in the pizza segment.\n",
      "The food was tasty, but I expected more variety. The service was excellent, the girls are extremely polite. Fair price!\n",
      "Typical Brazilian food with great taste.Their meat is very tasty and worth it. I love the broccoli with garlic and the flour to accompany the meats ordered. Nice food!\n"

      "Delicious pizza and entrees.We were very well attended by Carliane, a super friendly and attentive waitress. We ordered some entrees and then a salty and sweet pizza, all delicious.The pizza has a super thin and crunchy dough and lots of flavor options.\n",
      "Although I don't particularly like McDonalds fastfoods, it is a pleasant environment and has a very tasty McFlurry\n",
      "Wide variety of meats, excellent barbecue from Santa Catarina, simple but quality buffett, airy, ample parking .. Dessert options. Excellent place for those who enjoy more open and airy environments. Ideal to go with the family\n",
      "I came to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and I had a very good experience. Fair prices for what is offered, and very good service. A worthwhile experience.\n",
      "Inexpensive menu, consistent with the quality of the food, noble meat in the Filet is against filet. Despite the pleasant atmosphere, the draft beer is hot and has no coca cola products. Bad waiters. The city must have something much better.\n",
      "The price is good, one of the cheapest in the region and the restaurant is clean, but unfortunately, it is not 100% vegetarian. There are many options, but there are dishes made with milk and eggs. and the worst: without identification. It is complicated to eat at ease at the risk of eating dishes with eggs or milk. If they corrected that part, it would be the best restaurant in the region.\n",
      "Food is well served, the dish is very tasty and comes a lot ... The prices are a little high, but expected for a restaurant at the airport.\n",
      "Perfect service, without words .. especially for Antônio José, Eduardo .. thank you very much for all the reception .. I highly recommend .. Coco Bambu - Dom Pastel\n",
      "For lunch Monday through Friday you will find a varied buffet of Tex-Mex style dishes. None of them are loaded with pepper, so it pleases all audiences. Saturday does not have buffet service.\n",
      "Great place to chat, cozy and with a diversity and suggestions for a quick snack or even dinner !!\n",
      "At the Primavera restaurant I ate the typical maranhão food for the first time and loved it. Now I will always come back.\n",
      "Best pizza in Curitiba, Great experience, with families and friends, perfect service, and great structure.\n",
      "The Subway network, without a doubt, is wonderful. But the Rodoviária do Ti ~ ete franchise is a disaster. Bad service, time consuming, small and dirty space, does not have the cheapest and promotional combos, in short, tragic!\n",
      "We went as a family to try a carvery at this restaurant and when we arrived at the place we found that the carvery was not provided due to lack of salmon. Japanese restaurant without salmon!\n",
      "A very good restaurant with a regional menu. The famous guaiamum (a type of crab) is available in an aquarium where you can choose which one to taste. Note 10 for Mexido do Mar.\n",
      "A pleasant surprise. Restaurant by the kilo with exquisite quality of both regional and Japanese food. Japanese self with sashimi. And the Avalanche dessert is divine.\n",
      "The restaurant has new features, with a very comfortable and well located environment (if you have a car, you will have some difficulty parking on the street - Pça Popular -, but there are parking lots nearby). The service was very good! The dish surprised me positively, all the way I ordered (they have five points of meat highlighted on the menu, with colors). Dessert also pleased. The price, at lunch, very good, great cost benefit!\n",
      "Great. Tasting point whose stop should be mandatory when visiting Fortaleza, eating at Vignoli not only satisfies the taste, which is unique, but throughout the structure, the proven specialty and the correct choice of its creators.\n",
      "Located on the red river. It is more of a show house and bar than a restaurant. I recommend it for bar meals and listening to good samba with chatting with friends. The food is typical of boteco, such as feijoada, snacks, josefina, carne do sol.\n",
      "Both at noon and at night, despite being rotizio, the food is quality. It is the typical place that you eat too much, due to the variety of food. It's not that cheap, but for those who eat a lot it is worth it.\n",
      "The price is salty but it is the best steakhouse in the region. Varied meats, including beef, pork, chicken, pheasant, wild boar and others. Table of cold cuts and accompaniments of excellent quality and lots of variety. Dessert with fine pastries and ice cream.\n",
      "Very good snack, excellent service, pleasant place and recommended for all ages, super clean.\n",
      "It is a great place for happy hour. Variety of beers all handcrafted and brewed right at your fingertips. Delicious snacks and affordable price. It is worth the visit to know a very interesting place at Estação das Docas.\n",
      "We went for a pizza and the waiter overheard us saying it was our son's birthday. He asked if we would allow a tribute and brought a fun cotton candy cake for us to sing congratulations. Place with super cold beer, good pizza and delicacy in the service. Very good.\n",
      "Although the place is always full, the snack came out quickly and was very good.The great location helps, is on a main avenue, but sometimes there is no place to park.I liked the taste of the snack and the service.\n",
      "weak, expensive place, half mouth, poor service, poor cleaning, half mouth food, half mouth waiters, good space, good location\n",
      "My daughter loves cheese cake and we went to Le Pain to taste some sweets, when she came face to face with one, it is just wonderful! One of the best we've ever eaten. In addition, the place is very pleasant and the service is impeccable. I want to go back and eat the tiramisu, which looks spectacular. The price is a little bit more than the market price, but due to the flavor and size of the candy, it's worth it!\n",
      "Excellent service, extremely attentive people, very good food, pleasant waiting time. I recommend\n",
      "Sunny day (not too hot) is certainly the best place in town to spend a few hours with a group of friends.\n",
      "We ordered 3 things, of which only one was really Good. The chicken wing was very spicy, the meat of the sun was EXTREMELY SALTED and a goat sausage came out sturdy, very tough! What saved was the pork rib\n",
      "First gastronomic experience I had in Recife and it couldn't have been better. Relaxed atmosphere, tasty food (we ate the goat). The cheese skewer with shrimp entry was great. Cold and tasty draft beer. Special point of care, we were staying at the Grand Mercury and they offered us a free transfer service to the hotel after the meal. I recommend!\n",
      "The bar & restaurant attracts mainly for the view of São Paulo and its attraction is, in my view, one of its defects, since it is difficult to get close to actually see the view of the city. Despite this, the atmosphere is extremely welcoming, charming, but expensive. I found the price of a long neck R $ 18 reais or a gin and tonic just over R $ 40 reais to be abusive. Meat for just over R $ 90 reais and salmon, around R $ 70. The dishes were very well prepared: the meat really came divine and in a sensational sauce. At a dinner for 4, with wine, cost R $ 500 for each couple.\n",
      "Best cost-benefit of João Pessoa steakhouses. Nice atmosphere and service. Well done meats. Sushi not so much. Plentiful cold table. For the price it is very worth it. Do not arrive after 13: 00h as the queue is long ... maybe the weekday is shorter, but the weekend is not possible until this time.\n",
      "A very traditional restaurant, located in the public market, very central place, but has no parking. The waiters are very attentive and old-fashioned at the establishment. quantdo we were at the restaurant we ate a delicious gomes de sá cod.\n",
      "Liked it. ..rodio well done, attentive waiters, although I order salmon temaki with Shimeji and they send me only salmon. ..alright!\n",
      "Very well located, very close to the beach of Boa Viagem, this restaurant serves a good variety of options at lunch time. If you are looking for a self service by weight, this is a good option.Open and pleasant place to sit and chat.It could have an air-conditioned lounge ...\n",
      "Cozy atmosphere, excellent service, well mannered waiters. Fast service. I recommend it to anyone in the North Zone of SP\n",
      "Located at the top of the Unique hotel in São Paulo, this restaurant surprises with its visual, customer service.I recommend it for all situations and celebrations. The red pool is a charm in itself.\n"

      "Very traditional restaurant in Salvador, maintains the family atmosphere and the impeccable quality of the dishes! Different options, extensive wine list and no cork!\n",
      "One of the worst cost-benefit ratios I have ever encountered, reasonable food, looks like frozen and reheated food, expensive, very expensive for what it offers.\n",
      "In addition to the gastronomic quality of Japanese food, there are options such as crab cakes and oysters. The carvery system is interesting, as the waiter serves you as in a carvery. They don’t put a lot of stuff on your table like everyone else. You get what you really want.\n",
      "We went via Restaurant Week and had the opportunity to eat some dishes. What most attracted our attention in a positive way was the seasoning of the dishes and the dessert.Local and small, it is worth arriving early.I want to come back one day to try the carvery.\n",
      "Quiet atmosphere, food truck on the sidewalk.Very tasty hamburger, a very juicy blend and a very soft and brand new bread.Well stuffed and tasty salted tapioca.Doce meets the expectation.As it is on the street, no table accommodations for everyone, but there are extra stools and chairs and no one stands.\n",

      "The food is very good, because it is a kilo you can try a little of everything. I love Moroccan rice, I really love everything they prepare.Their salon is a clean decoration, worth visiting.\n",
      "My husband and I were at Janga for dinner. Our experience was wonderful, starting with the reception, all the staff very friendly and attentive, especially Arthur and William, who treated us with great affection.The food is wonderful, cold drink, sophisticated atmosphere.Anyway ... We love Janga !!!\n",
      "The location is sensational. If you want romanticism, go upstairs where the food is delicious and the service is impeccable. The salmon tartar was divine, but the wine, fresh pasta and dessert are as good as ... The Italian waiter is a charming part of the place.\n",
      "Every evaluation generates controversy, depends on our perception, mood and also how the house service is doing. I went to Jamile twice (the last after the theater) and I was always well attended and ate well. The restaurant is in the middle of canteens and some very traditional ones like Bassi and Mexilhão. The wine list is expensive and without many options (how about paying more attention to whites and rosés? Summer is coming ...). At the beginning we ordered a tasty white fish ceviche. Refreshing and with just the right acidity. Then, the octopus with quinoa salad and I confess that it was one of the best octopuses I've eaten in recent times (as good as 212 and Myk). For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cigar (best seller of the house). You expect a hard dough and are surprised by a crunchy, thin dough. A very delicious dessert for those who enjoy chocolate and pistachios. The atmosphere is relaxed, there is a counter in the back where you can have meals, but I never tried it. I just find the small tables and chairs a little uncomfortable. It doesn't really match the prices charged. The food is very good and tasty. Jamile wants to be cool and informal but charges restaurant prices superior in comfort and service. There are restaurants in SP that for the same price charged by Jamile, offer a superior experience. But I think it's worth knowing for the good dishes.\n",
      "Buffet with a wide variety of Arab food, very tasty! Cozy place, extremely attentive waiters. Great service from the entrance to the exit. Place has parking. The carvery is a separate show! Great place for a family lunch.\n",
      "Good bakery with good food and drink options. The salty is very good and has several types of snacks. Well qualified service.\n",
      "I asked for it twice in the tele delivery and I had no problem. The pizzas are great, I just think that in chocolate pizza, they should put real chocolate, because they put a cream like chocolate porridge, which is not bad, only it could be real chocolate, right? I have nothing to complain about the rest.\n",
      "I was in a meeting with classmates, nice place, cold beer, tasty snacks and good music! Great for a happy hour!\n",
      "I went with 4 more friends at lunchtime from work. We went at 13h, with rain and still had to queue to enter rs. It didn't take long, but I recommend that you pay attention to the time available to go there or try to book.The place is small, but comfortable and we were well attended.About the snack, I ordered the hamburger with the combo of fries and an orange juice. I found it very tasty. Meat at the point I ordered and I was very pleased with the size.I recommend and intend to return to the place!\n",
      "A new and good option in the neighborhood. A wide variety of beers is the forte of the house. The gorgonzila counter-fillet is the flagship of the kitchen deservedly.\n",
      "We returned to the restaurant after a long time, in the same location. There is no parking, you need to leave it on the street. The place has little space and is very cramped. The service and efficient service. Menu with several options, and a little different from the traditional. It takes a long time to prepare the dish outside of traditional sfiha dishes, raw kibbeh, ... We ordered lamb trolley with Moroccan couscous - very good, except for the delay. The service and efficient service.\n",

At the bottom of the restaurant there is an area prepared to welcome large groups. We were in 15 people where everyone ordered different dishes.

The place is small, it was full, we could only sit on the counter, but the air conditioning was wonderful, so it relieved the feeling of tightness. The service was very good. The waiter warned about the point of each burger to avoid surprises, which I thought was quite valid. In fact it is very tasty. I intend to go back.\n",

Pasta made at home, you can eat a tagliolini with truffled funghi, with fillet slices, truffle oil and padano money. Good wine list and the good noise of a good Italian canteen. Worth a visit.\n",

      "We arrived at the restaurant on a Thursday night and the restaurant was very crowded (and it seemed to us that they don't have the infrastructure for that). We waited at the door until one of the waiters came to guide us to a table, but no one came. We went in anyway and got a table. After calling several waiters (there were only a few), we finally managed to order the menu but although we were in five people there were only two menus available. The food is really delicious and elaborate, however, time consuming and the quantity of portions is small, that's why we find the prices high for the quantity.\n",

      "I was alone for lunch on a Saturday at the Pot Orchestra. The reception was very good and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I asked for a glass of sparkling wine and water to open the works. Gradually the restaurant was receiving more customers and everyone was being served very well. I ordered my plate, a risotto with filet mignon that was not long in coming. The meat point was perfect, the way I asked. The risotto was excellent too. The dessert was the pota cota, which did not draw sighs. Everything was going very well when the waiter brought me another glass of sparkling wine - which I accepted because I thought they realized that mine was out of the ideal temperature. Finally I asked for the bill, and to my surprise, they had charged me for the second glass of sparkling wine. Well, here is my assessment: I found it extremely impolite to push me a glass of sparkling wine that I did not order, since I had not finished my first one. Just for that detail, the whole experience was invalidated. I found it unfortunate, a serious flaw in the restaurant. If I wanted another drink, I would have asked. For that one reason I will not be returning to this restaurant and will not recommend it to my friends.\n",

      "Although the environment is pleasant and the açaí is tasty, the Tribe is not the same as before. The food lost a lot in quality, and the prices just went up. The last times I was there, I had a stomach ache with simple pasta (Genoa and Giro d'Italia), I was VERY poorly attended (we even complained a few times, but the apathetic attendants made a face of the landscape and pretended they didn't even hear it ), and I was unlucky enough to catch the garbage overflowing when using the bathroom.

      "Dishes very well explained before being served and wonderfully well prepared! Loved the service and the menu!\n",
      "Simple facilities, the restaurant is cramped and noisy.But what impressed me most was The price on the menu, which is average for Alto, masses around 60/70 reais and there is no reason to charge this amount, since it is a simple restaurant in its setting, and the food is nothing. .A DomCamilo, there in Bolivar gives ten and is the same price.

As a side dish, porteño puree (potatoes and mandioquinha) and julienne salad are my favorites. Special beers and wine selection are also very good. Oh, and for those who drink coffee, it comes with a plate with some sweet delights ... Pleasant atmosphere. Too worth the visit!\n",
      "I went to the restaurant by referral. The food is very expensive for what it proposes. Although they say the pasta and sauce are homemade, they are a real disaster. Bitter and sickening tomato sauce. The dishes have a terrible presentation, served in pyrex and poorly served with shrimp. The taste gives the impression that it was that dish prepared in a hurry.Very simple and uncomfortable environment. High price, expensive wine list, small and insufficient. There is practically no white wine to choose from, even though João Pessoa is a warm and beach town. Quality of service from the waiters was satisfactory.Whoever is visiting João Pessoa will easily find better restaurants, more sophisticated and with a better price. Don't waste your time.\n",

I have seen many of Gero's former workers in other restaurants.The food is good. Often able to order the menu without a problem. A classic lunch favorite is Penne Magali.The room is nice, but the real main attraction is the crowd. Very successful and high level. People watching, especially if you are a local. who are more apt to meet a neighbor in Gero than in their own building.Do not confuse this Gero with Gero in Barra.

      "One of the most famous pizzerias in Goiânia, well located in Setor Marista close to the main bars and restaurants in the city. It does not have its own parking. Although it has the impression of being an old house adapted to be a pizzeria, the environment is clean and pleasant, it has an outdoor area and an indoor heated but nothing very sophisticated. It has a playroom with monitors, but the downside is that it is on the upper floor via a ladder potentially dangerous for children. It has a wide variety of pizzas (traditional with or without filling, or thin) and well-prepared and delicious pasta. In addition to the already traditional flavors of pizzas, the house offers other different flavors that are out of the ordinary. Good wine list. Good service. Clean bathrooms.

At that point you have to improve a lot. The highlight is the quality of the meat. And in this regard, perhaps the steakhouse deserves a second chance.

      "Very good for meeting friends. There are options for vegan friends and a truck with several good beers (I don't remember the name but it was an ambulance hahaah). Outside, the owners could take their pets there <3\n",
      "When you enter the place you already know that this is a different place. With millions of different themes, each wall has its theme and, every time you look to the side, you find something you haven't seen yet. The caipirinhas and drinks are wonderful. When I went, it was a little empty, but it was still pretty tasty! The samba that plays is very typical. Perfect place to take gringos!\n",
      "The lunch was impeccable. Very well prepared homemade food, variety, salads and some meatballs from the gods. The wonderful dessert. I recommend!!!\n",
      "Sunday 19/02/2017, I was having lunch at the restaurant I was very poorly attended, the food was not good it seemed reheated the point of the dough and to make matters worse at the end I had a big surprise, I asked that the 12% of service was NOT charged and even so it was charged without my authorization, as I was in a hurry I didn't notice it at the moment only after I checked the amount credited on the cell phone.\n",
      "Relaxed place with excellent service.Attractive menu and fair prices.Even the monkey that gives a little is cool lol\n",
      "The place looks like a bar, but it is one. Great restaurant. The dish made with rice, beans, manioc, farofa, fried cockroach, salad, vinaigrette and mixed red meat, chicken and linguicinha comes to R $ 29.00 - if you want to include mignon and picanha, the value goes to R $ 35, 00. The carvery costs R $ 72.00.\n",
      "We met Bodega do Veio at another stop made during our tour of the Historic City of Olinda accompanied by a local guide named Maciel. Our entire itinerary was done on foot. At the time we were accompanied by a 4 year old child. In some moments it was necessary to give a lap, but as a whole she followed the tour well. As Maciel realized that we had already stopped at Venda do Seu Biu and bought a beer, he suggested that we stop there too to visit and buy another can. It is another one of those unusual and somewhat curious places. It looks like a warehouse but very organized. People sit at the counter and eat and drink right there. It has a varied drinks menu and takes away taste too. We just bought the beer and went on the tour. It was full and excited! I don't think it would be a place to stay with a child. We saw a board of cold cuts that looked delicious!\n",
      "Here you can taste different types of sausages and cheeses in a different way. The caipirinha with three lemons is also delicious.\n",
      "The atmosphere is very pleasant! Arriving before 8 pm is recommended, but the wait takes place in a very cozy place.Excellent dishes, with compatible, fair prices.The shrimp in the strawberry is a show of ball.\n",
      "Nothing spectacular, but the draft beer is cold and the snacks are reasonable. It wouldn't be my first choice, but I would go with friends, as I have been.\n",
      "The location is very good and well located.It has many varieties of flavors, both for savory pizzas, as for sweet pizzas.It has excellent service and prices are very affordable.Ideal for taking the family or a larger group of friends.Worth knowing.I recommend.\n",
      "I went to the site twice in the same month.I really enjoyed the first time, when I ate a Chorizo ​​Steak. It wasn't the best I've ever eaten, but it was very good, the meat was excellent. I asked for Ponto Mais because I had already heard that the house excels at the point and usually comes with a lot of blood. So it was the sweet spot that I appreciate.The second time we ordered a fillet for two people. The waitress asked if we wanted to open the meat (butterfly), I said I had no need, because I like the file to the point, with the medium pink. However, I think the cut was higher than I expected and the medium was very raw, I should have asked to open it, and leave less point.And besides, this second time I felt that the meat had a strange taste, almost with a taste of old. But I thought it was 4:30 pm and I was having lunch late one Saturday, so it was the best we could have at that time.I will try a third time, to have the first good impression again!\n"

      "I had already gone to another chain restaurant to eat pizza and this time I was at lunch and tried the buffet.We paid R $ 65.00 per person which included different proteins, pasta and risotto, in addition to the proteins.The service in this restaurant is exceptional, especially if you consider that it is not an expensive restaurant.Would go back with ctz.\n",
      "Great service and great food! It is very worth knowing! Quick dishes and cool prices.\n",
      "For those who like chopps are great (according to my boyfriend) and the price at happy hour is even better. The snacks are warm and the taste is wonderful.\n",
      "Great gastronomic experience :) whenever I can have lunch or dinner in this restaurant !!!\n",
      "Good service, good food, but normal, with nothing exceptional for the price. Pleasant environment. Paid parking.\n",
      "It is a bistro that, as the name suggests, offers healthy dishes with fresh ingredients. I loved the vegetable spaghetti (!) With tomato sauce and shrimp. The presentation of the dishes is very pleasant and the taste pays off. Good cost-benefit...\n",
      "Get there early. Enjoy the queue with the excellent drinks and the correct tickets. The lamb palette was perfect. Attentive service, but needs to improve. I recommend lunch that reminds a lot of the informality of the Greek islands.\n",
      "This restaurant also has a unit located within the Rio Branco airport. At this location, lunch is a self-service type with lots of meat and other dishes. The place is air conditioned and very quiet so you can have a meal before or after traveling.\n",
      "Everything very good, from the service (especially to the waiter Leandro), the delicious dishes, mega cold beer, wonderful dessert ...Loved it. I will always come back.\n",
      "Excellent place, haute cuisine, mouth-watering desserts! I ate a chicken fillet with grilled vegetables and salad, simple and delicious! Recommend for any occasion\n",
      "The dishes are super creative and the atmosphere is very themed and fun. It takes a little patience to look at the entire menu as it is INFINITE. I believe that they could focus only on hamburgers and leave the rest of the dishes aside, since the hamburger is the dish that comes out the most. The price is a little high for the dish served, I believe it could be much more affordable. Service was good and fast, drinks are very different too.\n",
      "The restaurant is beautiful, the location is incredible, the view is breathtaking, but the service .... mega slow. Approx 1h to come drink and food. Poor service excellence makes it expensive to be there. Two starters, a roska + a shot of vodka: 229.00 reais. If the experience was good, it would be worth it ... obs: we stayed in the external area\n",
      "The place is very cozy, well organized. It's not very big, so don't go with 248473 friends.The pizza is very good. It has few flavors, which in my opinion facilitates the choice. Thin pasta and striking flavors. They use a lot of creamcheese, which goes well with pizza.The price is right for the product. It is neither expensive nor cheap. Average price.Two points that I consider as problems that can be solved ... 1. IT IS VERY HOT, it gets to bother the heat. Suggestion to refrigerate the place. 2. CAUTION WHEN PARKING, in front of the place there are castanet trees that can damage your car. Park a little bit away or take the risk.\n",
      "The pies are wonderful, especially the dry tomato with ricotta. The price is right.It is certainly the best PE pie.The employees Gabriel and Victor Hugo do an excellent job in service, they are very attentive and professional.Congratulations.\n",
      "Very delicious food, good location, very quiet environment and first class service. It is worth checking.\n",
      "very attractive barbecue and great variety of dishes for wild service, good quality food and pleasant atmosphere, .. recommend\n",
      "Cozy place, with kids space, tables inside and outside. Due to the promotions for skewers, if you order a caipirinha you get another one, if you drink a beer you get another one very worth it !!!!!\n",
      "Delicious food, but very tasty. The space has undergone renovations and improved more, it was less tight.\n",
      "If you are in doubt at the time of a meal, go to Restaurante Almanara. Raw, fried kibe, steak on horseback, cigar, Kafta and others. all meals are delicious and the price is fair.It does not open on Sundays for dinner, only lunch.\n",
      "One of the best meals we've tried in recent times. Exceptional meat. Same service. Thanks to Sergio, who served us very well. We will be back.\n",
      "Wonderful food and super nice atmosphere. Excellent for those not from Piauí to know our cuisine.\n",
      "Great location close to Ipanema beach, very good place, quality food, well prepared dishes and great service!\n",
      "The shrimp starter was delicious, but the burger itself is nothing special. Soy sauce. There are other options in the region with better prices and much more delicious.\n",
      "Modern, comfortable and pleasant atmosphere. Varied menu with several good options between sweet and savory croissants, cold drinks and excellent coffees. Highlights for Filé cinco cheeses croissants and chocolate with strawberries. The Nutella milk shake is delicious. Very good service.\n",
      "The place is well known and frequented by the high society of Goiânia, but, in my opinion, it has more 'fame' than it deserves. The place is very beautiful, pleasant atmosphere, good service (but needs to be improved), but with regard to pizzas, I see nothing exceptional, to the point of having gained the fame it has. I believe that the fame is due to the beauty and sophistication of the place.\n",
      "Restaurant is good, with quite tasty food. Average service, but it is standard in the city. The cost benefit is worth it.\n",
      "Good food, ample location, reasonable prices and very popular. To talk it is good to get tables outside because the tables that are close to the televisions cannot chat because the TVs (there are several and each room is a different program with the sound at full steam) has the volume at maximum.\n",
      "I had lunch at Pérgula with a friend and my experience was wonderful. Excellent service ... friendly and efficient. We ordered an arugula salad with fig and sheep's cheese (simply a must, the best of life). We shared it with two people and then each one ordered a plate. The mushroom risotto was impeccable too, and the cocoa and cupuaçu dessert is an explosion of flavors. The atmosphere is super nice, we stayed outside. The prices are high and the portions are not very large, but I believe it is really the proposal. It is worth going, as it is sure to be a great experience.\n",
      "I have been there a few times, before and after the name change and in all of them I leave satisfied, the last one in April, we ate a Motown Club with accompaniments, great atmosphere and service.\n",
      "What really stands out is the quality of the food. The fish is very fresh and the price is fair. For those who like to enjoy good pairs and do not mind not having a luxurious environment, it is an exceptional option!\n",
      "The palate is a differentiated super market in Maceió. Open 24 hours a day, he is the only one who works this way in the city. It has a home section (1st floor) and in the super market it has a variety of good quality products (with imported ones) that you usually don't find easily in other supermarkets in the city. The Palato Café (in the background) is a great option for snacks and meals, as well as snacks for happy hour. The price is a little above average, but worth it. I indicate.\n",
      "Snack bar with many options of snacks and juices, located in various points of the city of Salvador, excellent for those looking for a quick snack.\n",
      "Good food, soft and tasty picanha. Simple environment, inside a gas station. Good service. Reasonable price, about 110 reais the steak for 4 (4 pieces of steak and side dishes).\n",
      "It has the best rib in Brazil ... it is famous for this dish ... the other meats are always well served and succulent ... however if you want to eat rib no other place is better..it is close to the biggest mall in Campo Grande. .\n",
      "I had two unique and terrible experiences with this place. On both visits I went to the invitation of friends who decided to celebrate their birthdays there and left wishing never to return. One was around 2012 or 2013, another was now in November, but nothing has changed.Without exaggeration, it's the worst service I've ever seen in a bar. The waiters treat you as if they are doing you a favor. They pretend they didn't see you calling, write down too much drink on the card and instead of correcting the note they bring in too much. It is a show of absurdities. And if you call another waiter asking to correct the order he still answers you if he wrote it down, he will bring it. It sounds like a joke.My last visit lasted a record 40 minutes, because it is impossible to stay in a crowded place, with poor service and drinking a terribly hot beer. The double round was almost a punishment: they brought you both draft beer at once. Then the business that arrives hot stays on the table, heating up even more. It's ridiculous.The food is expensive and also disappointing. I ordered a portion of angu pastry with cheese filling that arrived half hot, half cold. Cold, badly fried, with the cheese in pieces inside the pastry, there was no time to melt.I paid the bill, left, and I never plan to go back. I suggest that you also don't go. There is a much better place in town for you to spend your money, go for me.\n"

The individual potatoes serve two people and the large portion serves much more than 3!The sound is loud, but the atmosphere is modern and cool, to go with the crowd.Still, the snacks are awesome!\n",
      "The restaurant is located in Brasília shopping, so it is a good location.The food is simple, but tasty.The positive point is the purchase of lunch boxes, which considerably reduces the amount to be spent on the meal.The negative point is the grilled ones, which are dry and often pass the point.Recommended for a quick meal.\n",
      "I happened to discover this new cafe in the center of Recife, on the corner of Av. Visconde de Suassuna and Rua Gervásio Pires. The wi-fi is very good and I was surprised to find the daily newspaper and a variety of magazines as well. The standard is the same as the franchise, with dark wood furniture and the menu includes lunch.It is spacious, with several environments but the best I found was the part of the sofas, which is close to the plasma TV.\n",

In addition to the wonderful service, we were able to choose a good and very good wine straight from the very complete cellar of the place. The food was delicious, codfish cake and salmon risotto were divine. We finished lunch with a delicious dessert!\n",

      "Unfortunately in the last stay in this place the experience was not very good with the carvery, pizza with burnt edge, hard and not to mention the delay of the waiters to pass the tables. Being necessary to have to speak several times with the manager to request the passage of the waiters at the table with the pizzas ... anyway. At the moment, I do not recommend\n",
      "This house keeps stories, but its reform left a lot to be desired in acoustics. But the sandwich didn't lose its flavor. Excellent milk shake and has parking !!! Rarity in Sao Paulo! There is no time to receive sampa nightlife! It even has a vegetarian menu !!!\n",
      "I called the restaurant to make a reservation and heard the phrase: “today we don't make reservations, the house is quiet. It is on a first come, first served basis ”.I go to the restaurant and when I get there I am greeted by the manager, in a very bad mood, who tells me I only have two table options for me to sit. Being that I arrived at 20:20 and visualized at least 6 empty tables.Then I asked: And these tables, why can't I sit at them? And the manager replies: “they are booked and the reservation is until 9:15 pm”. I didn't understand anything, first when making reservations, when I arrive, half the restaurant has empty reserved tables. I wondered ... which restaurant works with reservations until 9:15 pm? I was disappointed, do not recommend.\n",

      "He did not receive a maximum score, as the waiter's service was not good, even some people at the table did not accept to contribute with the tip, which made the waiter furious and was very unpleasant. We were in more than 10 people, we spent more than 700.00 and even then we were not well served, the place is excellent, but you need to review the service.\n",
      "Wonderful food and ambience, service is also second to none. The couple of brownies is a great dessert order.\n",

The options are ideal, and the dishes navigate through different options. A Brazilian touch in each of them is the surprise for the food, we opted for the Gnocchi of Mandioquinha and Crocrantes do Mani. In the main course, we went to pig and house fish, all incredible.

Yes and here we had this experience. A Peruvian restaurant with a Nikkei touch.We arrived early, there was already a movement. We asked for a suggestion of entry to the waiter, who was very helpful and showed us a starter ceviche, Cebiche de Nazca, which was delicious.Behold, when we asked for the main dish suggestion we were kindly attended to by the chef who owns it, Simone Bert, who asked what we liked and so made the suggestions. Individual dishes, well decorated and with striking aromas. For the suggestion we ordered a Pescado Chankay, this one with a mixture of flavors and aromas combined with a bittersweet flavor, and we ordered the Pescado Don Juanito, this a sensational Lula dish stuffed with shitake rice and a grilled fish.What can I say, yes we had a gastronomic experience above expectations.Remembering that the restaurant is very cozy, with the careful attention of your Chef and team!If you want to be surprised by the typical Peruvian delicacies, you must try it.\n",

The filet cost about $ 60 and was very worth it, because it came with a LOT of meat, a very high file.For dessert with chocolate spaghetti, it was good ... But it was not the strong dessert of the house, indicated by the waiterHas an executive menu during the week or during the day\n",

We asked for the starters, and on the order of the waiter I ordered dish 808 and 806 came, a dish with peppers (I'm not a fan at all). At the time I saw that it was not the dish I love (lemon risotto), I felt sorry for the waiter, because I know that this amount would come out of his pocket. I shouldn't have had do, 'cause I'm feeling sick so far, I couldn't eat anything after lunch. And lunch, which was supposed to be a celebration, was a disappointment.

      "Good service, wonderful food, one of the best souffles I've ever eaten in my life! Delicious desserts, well worth it!\n",
      "The restaurant is well located, has wonderful service and delicious food. Ideal for special moments for two, with family oh friends.\n",
      "I went there on Saturday the place was full but it was worth the wait because I wanted to know. The service was disastrous, there is a different menu for drinks, weekdays and was not warned. The service was very slow, both to order a snack and to ask for the bill. The sandwich is tasty, but it came cold. The environment is cool.\n",
      "Good variety, tasty typical foods, great service, background music with big screen and drinks with varieties\n",
      "Very good restaurant, pleasant atmosphere, impeccable service. However, I found that the carvery was not worth it for the price. It has a lot of variety, but I believe that the flavor of a specific dish is better, with a price to match!\n",
      "Unfortunately it was not the first time in Manaus that an establishment informs that it opens on a certain day and time, I go and find the place closed! I think this is a lack of respect for the consumer !!! The website informs that the Vieiralves unit opens at 8am. I arrived at 9am and it was closed. I won't be back!\n",
      "This new option in São Luís has a cozy atmosphere, nothing much, but the restaurant has good comfort. The service is good, the improvement is due to their training, they should know the dishes better. We ordered a paella, a cod enumerates filet with roquefort cheese. All dishes were excellent, with first class ingredients and the quality of the food is excellent. The restaurant has a wine cellar but does not have good labels or a great variety. Well located, close to the beach and some hotels is worth the visit.\n",
      "Nice atmosphere and attentive waiters. Food can improve a lot. For the value, much more is expected. It has the potential to be a good restaurant in the mall.\n",
      "Food is not tasty, the draft beer is watery and the price is expensive. That is, with so many options in the surroundings, I do not intend to return.Ah, the service also leaves something to be desired.\n",
      "In all the items in my assessment, it exceeded my expectations, be it environment, service, service, variety of options.It's really worth it.\n",
      "... delicious, good variation of dishes, we went for a coffee in the late afternoon and ended up stretching a little more. Organized service and good service, in addition to the friendliness of Chef Ana Silva. Big hug from the friends of Cacoal-RO\n",
      "Very good! Nothing different from the others, but the location helps a lot. Long live the 'cheap' of the subway;)\n",
      "Typically regional meal, varied menu, good service! Price, a bit salty, but worth checking for the quality and choice of dishes, whether self-service or a la carte. Tapioca, sun meat, mashed cassava, fried or cooked cassava, salads, etc. All very good indeed!\n",
      "The pizza dough is thin and crunchy. Very tasty.In addition, the service is very good and they serve very fast.After less than 15 minutes they have already served the pizza. And it was very warm, crispy ... A delight.A positive point, is the price. Good product and fair price.\n",
      "The restaurant is a great idea for Chef Claude Troisgros. In this restaurant you choose the meat, of excellent quality and very well prepared, and the side dishes are served on a rotating basis. This system allows you to taste the various side dishes served at the house. I liked everyone I tried, hard to say which one is the best, even the chayote souffle is good.\n",
      "The restaurant provides a good physical space, very well organized and clean. Its decoration is excellent, but it sins in the main part of a restaurant, the food. Unfortunately my experience was bad. The food was totally tasteless and was not tasty. In terms of food quality, I say it is low. But it provides quite a variety of food.\n",
      "If you want a quiet place to have lunch in the middle of the chaos of the city center, this is the place!The tables are in a wooded place and then the visit to the Anchieta Museum is worthwhile, with works from the Jesuit era, sacred art and also a visit to the old crypt.Very interesting!\n",
      "I love the meat Kebab Durum! Whenever I can I felt the edge and I appreciate one together with a very cold bottle of Coca Cola that guarantees a good meal! There are days I want to eat and only chicken: o (\n",
      "Unprepared attendants, food took too long !, my children went to my niece's birthday celebration and she was the last to be attended ..... after 1 ½ hours!When did you complain to the manager, guess what? You are affectionate huh!I'll never be back!\n",
      "very good quality pizzas and crepes, always with a good service with many flavors and good price.\n",
      "This bar, is about 30 meters from the Palace flat, has excellent service, several brands of beers, always very cold and so with the sliced ​​steak in the spot, a place of happy people.\n",
      "One of the best restaurants in Macapá. It has a quality service with attentive and well prepared waiters to serve well. The menu is varied with many options of fish, shrimp and other dishes also at a very good price.The atmosphere is welcoming with a decoration that matches the name of the restaurant. One of the best in Macapá.\n",
      "Small and cozy place. A simple canteen, but it has a good wine list, the pasta is made there, delicious and light. The service is good and the prices compatible with the location. Almost always full, having to wait for a vacant table. However, I think it is worth it.\n",
      "If you want to enjoy the company of friends it is good food, don't miss this place! Cozy atmosphere and good food! Enjoy.\n",
      "Very beautiful and cozy place. Menu with fantastic dishes and very well prepared drinks. Fast service. I had a fantastic lamb risotto.\n",
      "What a tasty shrimp dumpling, pleasant atmosphere with a view of the crab walkway.Accompanied by a large jar of coconut water was a very tasty stop\n",
      "Nice place with good air conditioning. Good food with a reasonable price. Well-trained and responsive employees. I recommend the visit to anyone looking for a quick meal.\n",
      "Very good food.I was attended to by Max. He attentively suggested that I combine a starter with a salad and helped me choose the shrimp hiding place along with the seafood salad. Both dishes are delicious and well served (the escodidinho is a starter and the salad is larger than the standard), there was no room for dessert.Highly recommended.\n",
      "Varied menu, pizza with thin dough and many options of dishes, at great cost. Simple restaurant, but dishes are made with great care, always with the eye of the owner on top!\n",
      "I tried the best esfiha fresh out of the oven. They serve kibes and kaftas and rice with lentils, zucchini and stuffed eggplant, etc. It's good and cheap.\n",
      "The food is simple, but good. The price for that is not quite fair, but it is worth a visit now and then. There is a kids space, good for kids. The service is slow and, when the house is a little full, it is better to avoid it, because the team heads to get organized.\n",
      "we went to Djapa and went for the evaluation in the trio !! Overcame !! From the reception, waiters with impeccable rotation, with the right to know dear Manoel, who showed us a wonderful banana dessert flambéed with pear ice cream !! super recommended for Family, our kids loved it !!\n",
      "I have been going to Bar do Alemão for many years ... and I love it! Do not let to go. You can combine a visit to Largo da Ordem with lunch or dinner here. In the photo, the famous submarine - draft beer with stainhager - and you still have the souvenir cup.\n",
      "In the buffet there are varieties of exotic foods from Manaus, Tartaruga, alligator, stingray, duck in tucupi, among others and there is also a la-carte with steak and fillet the price is a bit steep, but it is worth checking, as the service is excellent .\n",
      "Great food with very good service. The dessert is also of high quality and price and within the average for a restaurant of this level.\n",
      "The restaurant is good, has good food, but the menu is restricted. The service is very attentive, but the price is a little expensive. It also has a good wine list. Definitely worth the visit.\n",
      "we had a different night. The place is spacious and beautiful. Very clean and excellent service. the food is very good and answered the expectation of my wife who went to Natal wanting to go there to eat as recommended by friends.\n"

      "I ordered a hamburger for 20 reais through the Rappi application. In the picture he looked perfect. It was a beef burger, with aioli, a jam that I forgot what it was exactly, cheese, bacon, bbq sauce, plus the potatoes. When the order arrived it was the biggest disappointment. First, the potatoes were not like the photo. There came potato chips like a potato ruffles or lays, in a meager quantity. Second, the burger was extremely bland. Meat without a different flavor, cheese and bacon in meager quantities, withered bread, without sauce, very dry. That is, a misleading advertisement of the product. I never ask again! There are options 100 times better in bh.\n",
      "Delicious ambience and food :)I went on a Sunday with friends. Wines with great prices and a friendly chef.\n",
      "I was yesterday 18/02/17 behind to eat a hamburger with quality. They had already told me that this place has artisanal hamburgers. Well, when I got there I saw that there were several exotic fillings like salmon hamburger, aratu and crab. As I wanted to eat meat, I ordered the rump and smoked pepperoni in Australian bread. Good staff really of a lot of quality and a different flavor from the snacks I had already eaten there. There is a sauce that they make that adds a flavor to the flavor. In summary, it is very worth it. The hamburger cost 18 reais and has promotions every day. Well, if you want to eat some quality hamburger this place is highly recommended\n",
      "Best duck rice I've ever eaten. Small portions. Lots of wine options. I recommend asking for pastries. super nice environment.\n",
      "Pleasant environment, has an outdoor area. Great place for a dinner by the sea with Avenida Beira Mar.Tasty and abundant food. The dish that serves in my opinion is for two people quiet.\n",
      "The chopps and beers are really good and have something for everyone. But the portions of taste are small and expensive, full of bread and chips to look bigger. Regular attendance and sanitary facilities.\n",
      "I normally avoid restaurants in shopping centers here in Salvador. But after several recommendations I decided to try Al Mare. The atmosphere is bright and welcoming. All the staff were extremely friendly and attentive, great service. And the food was excellent. Apparently the chef is cordon bleu-trained and it shows. After 30 years in Salvador it is wonderful to know that we finally have a top of the range seafood restaurant. It is not cheap, but contrary to what happens in many of the high class restaurants in Salvador it is value for money\n",
      "Excellent restaurant with exotic and tasty fish! Whenever we visit we order wild salmon and Alaskan seafood, I do not know another restaurant in Rio de Janeiro that offers.\n",
      "a great place to go, excellent Carne de Sol, both the fillet of picanha and the picanha itself, but there are other good regional dishes, but the strongest thing is the sun meat with the maria-izabel rice or baião de dois and the butter in the bottle and the starter has no equal, pastel with pepper jelly, very good.\n",
      "The restaurant is top ten!The service is always impeccable, warm and wonderful food.I love to eat the Meat Loaf as a starter and the Filé Hermanos and Filé del primo dishes.The price is a little high, but it is worth it for the taste of the meal.\n",
      "Saturday of the dead. From Caxias to Porto Alegre, two hours trip. 13:30 h. A good time for lunch. At Brasa steakhouse. Pleasant environment . Efficient waiter service. Now there are plated salads, brie cheese with honey and green leaves covering the stomach. Here comes the meats. Select thin slices of pink steak. Eat slowly. Aipins and fried onion rings to accompany. I look for my friendly waiter, which brings a beautiful empty skewer. The meat of the meats. As tasty as the rib. As soft as the picanha. I split between the two. It is almost 15 hours. I am satisfied. Very satisfied. I skip the desserts. A good coffee and the bill, please.I\n",
      "I was shopping and we stopped at this restaurant per kg for lunch, it seemed to us the most peaceful and clean in the region. It was a simple lunch, clean environment and food for everyday life. It was a good option for the region. I believe that one of the best in cost benefit\n",
      "great house, impeccable bands, cold beer.Excellent place to celebrate a birthday or get together with friends.\n",
      "A super nice bistro with cozy retro decor. The starters and main meals were divine and fairly priced. However, the service was not worthy of a maximum score, but it complied with the table.\n",
      "The variety of meats, salads, cheese buffet, appeals to all tastes. An excellent steakhouse in Goiânia. First-rate service. I recommend going through Goiânia. Well located.\n",
      "Nice and well decorated restaurant, highlight for the impeccable service. The pleasant ambient music, jazz, lounge, etc. The prawn gum flagship of the house was ok, but I would like to know the other options on the menu. I recommend.\n",
      "About three months ago I was at Varadero and I asked for the meat spot wrong (I don't like screaming meat). We called the waiter and explained that we had really ordered wrong and I would like to have the fillet we ordered a little more. To our surprise, the waiter served us a piece of coal. This even caught the attention of the manager, who came to our table to ask if we would like to exchange it, as it was too roasted. However, between our arrival and return to the kitchen and the return to the table, it was already about 1.5 hours. We preferred not to change because of the time we would have to wait - the house was full. But I thought it was a lack of respect, after all, we assumed our mistake in the request. I like the restaurant but I was a little disappointed, even with the manager's attention.\n",
      "Excellent service!Attentive waiters!Beautiful view of Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas!Familiar and peaceful environment to go with friends, boyfriend or family.\n",
      "The fixed menu has the traditional and old dishes of all times. The highlight is Medaillon a Piemontesa, whose rice is always good, the portion is plentiful. The lunch buffet is varied and has a reasonable taste. The price, for Barra, is moderate.\n",
      "Starting with the care of Valeria and the rest of the team: impeccable !!! There was a 45 minute wait, but we sat down long before that. We ordered a starter, which was very tasty (pasta and filling). The very good drinks and the ramens (Shoyu and Tom Tom) were exceptional. Experience and satisfaction couldn't be better. A pleasant surprise with the flavors and quantities. Fair prices for the quality and flavors served. Grade 10!!!!\n",
      "One of the best restaurants in Porto Alegre. Very cozy place for lunch or dinner. Menu changes weekly and always brings news and new flavors. Starter, main course is dessert. Everything well served. A delight. Not to mention the dearest owners: Leonardo is Liliana.\n",
      "the place is open and very beautiful. the menu features japanese, brazilian food and snacks. assorted drinks. Good for hot days.\n",
      "The chicken in the pot has become a tradition in the city, breaded and served with delicious sauces, worth a try. The restaurant also serves executive dishes, with meat options.\n",
      "It is well hidden. You know you came by the cars on the street, and the place is still in the back of the house.I loved the atmosphere: nice decor, attentive staff, just a price that is not cool !!! Very expensive!!!\n",
      "Nice place, decorated in the style of Italian canteens, with excellent service and delicious food. There is, at lunch, an alternative menu with cheaper dishes and with fitness dishes.\n",
      "For 36 reais a cheeseburger well served with accompanying fries, has a good cost-benefit. Also the chicken fingers for entry.Highlight for the homemade bread of hamburger made to order. However, there is a lack of seasoning in the meat, which, despite being tender, does not guarantee the slogan of the best hamburger in the world, which is a rather arrogant sentence.\n",
      "Different atmosphere, very good service and tasty mega Burger! I loved it! 😁👏🏼👏🏼 #ValeuMily #porpinotop #comidaboa\n",
      "it is worth going to this pizzeria, the first class service, a tasty and true pizza from São Paulo, the place belongs to a family of immigrants and therefore carries history, I will return to eat a pasta and the parmigiana file.\n"

      "Located next to the Coral Trade Center hotel, it is a good option for those who want to have a quick meal without having to take a taxi.The downside is that the location is very small. It only has two tables with 4 seats and a sofa that accommodates two more tables.\n",
      "Plenty of buffet options, drinks and desserts for one price! Pleasant space, delicious meals and perfect service!\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, lively music, it is very worthwhile to try the dried meat topped with butter, delicious ..\n",
      "Good self service option in Brasilia. Prices are a little high for a self service, but the quality pays off. The meats are very well done.\n",
      "The food itself is reasonable, but two facts will make me stay a long time without going back there: 1) tables at the back of the bar that they should not offer to families who are going to have lunch on Sundays. The chair is a medieval torture and the wobbly legs of the table require a lot of patience when cutting a steak 2) the lack of notion of charging 62.00 for a simple ravioli (R $ 35.50 for the pasta and another 26.50 for the bolognese sauce), you feel cheated, as it is the price of a restaurant with tablecloth and more attentive service. I do not recommend!\n",
      "What to say!? Wonderful options of chocolates and that meet the most varied tastes. This month you can enjoy the panettone.\n",
      "The restaurant is located in the Historic Center, with an atmosphere in the style of the old Italian canteens. The pastas are divine. Impeccable! The restaurant also has a sensational antipasti table.\n",
      "The environment is simple, open and airy. Excellent food at a good price. A great place to eat a toc-toc crab, a shrimp on the breath, have a cold beer (for those who like it) and have a good chat with friends.\n",
      "SPETTACOLARE !! Restaurant located in Água Verde has Vallet free, themed decoration and detailed 100% Italian cuisine. The local team has great structure, creativity in decoration and cordiality note 1000. I ordered a ravioli with the sauce of villnho + nat + parmesan without a doubt is the best I've ever eaten here in Curitiba, the wine cellar is assorted, ambient music with great taste and volume pleasant, cozy restaurant with varied and exclusive Italian menu, attentive, helpful waiters, agile orders and extremely fresh and tasty pasta. The restaurant has a reduced dessert menu with 4 options, but the Brownie is special. The place charges a 10% fee, the price is extremely fair for what they offer and they are very attentive and receptive. I just returned enchanted and without a doubt I recommend it !!\n",
      "Braz Tratoria has a menu with some pizzas! I didn't like the dough at all! Service is precarious! I had to ask the waiter to serve the pizza, since he was leaving it on the table. After serving it didn't cover any pizza!\n",
      "I love going to Outback, all the meetings with my college friends take place there. I love asking for Potato with Australian sauce, which is well served. The draft beer is cold, and my prayer for a non-alcoholic drink is iced peach tea.I love wings with medium pepper and the conversation never ends. Environment for young people and adults.\n",
      "Restaurant inside the Ritz Lagoa da Anta hotel. Food well served and quality. Good cost-benefit. I recommend.\n",
      "A delicious food, the super affordable price, good service, and always available to have a good meal or have a cold one!\n",
      "Perfect food, sophisticated and comfortable atmosphere.We ordered hidden meat, crab and beer.It is worth remembering that the flagship (Parmegiana) justifies the comments of this establishment.\n",
      "Once again I had the pleasure of tasting the best meat in BH! My friend Lorenzo, the owner, masterfully runs the establishment! Well trained, attentive waiters, first class service!  The dishes, however, can be ordered by anyone, because he chooses all ingredients and has professionals specialized in the preparation!Anyway, I am a loyal and very satisfied customer! It's really worth it! I pay with great pleasure!\n",
      "Bad service, I ordered an Oswaldo Aranha fillet that is not even close to the dish, served with potato chips when on the menu this Portuguese potato, garlic a garbage must be frozen, in short don't go if you like to pay too much, more expensive than in good restaurants in São Paulo to eat badly!\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, delicious food, with super fresh fish. The waiters were very attentive. I recommend!\n",
      "In addition to the wonderful food - I ate pasta with grilled meat - the service is worth highlighting. Very attentive, polite and professional people. Congratulations.\n",
      "It does not live up to advertising. We went for dinner: Cold food, the rice seemed warm and the meat of the sun tasted nothing, without grace. Lousy wait staff, unwillingness to serve. Very dark environment.\n",
      "Very good. I think the tables should have a little more lighting. Good service at the bar making personalized juices for my kids. Very sashimi !!I do not believe in sushi being synonymous with too high a price, but there the price is very high, being the negative point.\n",
      "Amazing and surprising Spanish restaurant. Excellent cost-benefit ratio to overcome times of crisis and demanding tastes. The slogan is true: rare foods and good wines. It is in Moema, but far surpasses the straightforward / tidy style of restaurants in the region. The decor is nice for Instagram photos, but without affectation. All the dishes I tried were delicious (and there were five!). Courteous and efficient service.To go many times and check all the menu options and then come back again to make you miss your favorite dishes!\n",
      "I need to give my arm to cheer: I shouldn't have taken so long to go there. We just LOVE the place and this is one of the tips that we are most looking forward to sharing with you.

      "A great choice for sandwiches, to please all types of taste. Good service and great location\n",
      "Depending on the time it is very busy. But keep the Girafas pattern. Most attendants are kind\n",
      "I've never eaten so much and so well in one place. The carvery is sensational and at a reasonable price for those who go from Monday to Thursday. It is even difficult to breathe so fast that they serve you. The atmosphere is pleasant, with live music and easy to reach.\n",
      "nice atmosphere, abundant beer and beer list and some snacks. cool to go out with friends and celebrate\n",
      "Wonderful restaurant, Minas Gerais food, tasty with its varied menu in dishes in addition to the delicacies of award-winning and internationally known cuisine.Acas dos contos is an unmissable address for anyone visiting the Capital of Minas Gerais.It is almost a tourist spot.Casa dos contos is an international and very traditional restaurant.\n",
      "Note 10. Regarding the quality of the pizza, we have nothing to talk about. Super nice place, high level service and experience that we can't wait to repeat.\n",
      "Super simple floating restaurant, always clean tables and with a Tucunaré marinade very well served !!! I recommend the marinade in the rainy season! If it's sunny, order the baked tambaqui! At the beginning a delicious fried manioc serving with a cold beer!\n",
      "the salad table is good, delicious food, quiet environment but lacking harmony, waiter doesn’t explain about the operation, keeps on his cell phone, terrible service, wouldn’t come back\n",

I just continue to think I could improve on myself, the Waiter Paraná and Silvio serve you very well, a Picanha, according to your taste. The manager and the Metres are very attentive, always passing by the table to check if something is missing, if it is, they provide it on time.The house is CONGRATULATED ... YOU CAN'T DROP THE STANDARD, THERE IS ALWAYS Q LOOKING FOR IMPROVEMENTS.\n"

      "I liked the place, although I am not vegan I really liked the variety of foods, it is very worth knowing. The carvery costs 39.00 per person and you can help yourself as many times as you like, the only thing I didn't like was the juice, because it was a more natural place I expected a juice with fruits and everything, I ordered a pineapple juice with mint and it didn't taste like pineapple, it was from a bottle (and there was pineapple in the salad and there was mint in their gardens), I didn't understand why they don't use fruits to make juice.\n",

      "The main dishes with a maximum price of R $ 35.00 show how expensive other restaurants in BH charge! Gennaro proves that it is possible to make quality food at a fair price, very fair!The wines at prices of 40 and 50 reais have also never seen in other restaurants. We had a 40.00 Portuguese wine which was great!Our dishes were wonderful, we loved the risotto! And finally, the Petit gateau, besides being beautiful, was perfect!We were very well attended by the waiter, the only thing I didn't know was that the waiters did not take orders for main course, only the maitre d '! Haha it may be a hindrance when the house is fuller, but in our case we didn't have to wait long!\n",

      "This pub has its burgers as its flagship. They are of the highest quality and very tasty. In addition, the restaurant has a varied menu of high quality beers. However the values ​​practiced in the place are very high. The hamburger costs around 35 reais and the cheapest 300ml beer costs 12 reais.\n",
      "The place is good, however, too small to meet the demand that Av. The piece of pizza really is big, and I honestly did not put faith that this piece of pizza was good, but I was surprised to see the size and especially eat it, I recommend the people to eat it, space is lacking, otherwise the place is very good.The service was very good too, I don't have to complain about it\n",

      "The service of the place is very good! But it takes good meat to compliment a steakhouse ... They didn't get one right! I tried several cuts, to no avail! This is not about the meat, but about the quality of the meat ... I was very, very disappointed! I can't praise a farofa with eggs, pastries and garlic bread in a place that serves meat !!! The price is incompatible with the place ... I do not suggest the place for those who like meat with good quality.\n",

      "The restaurant claims to be Argentine, but it lacks everything. Variety of meats, point, soap, side dishes. Meat to the point of less came completely raw. Side dishes are small. We also ordered a rib that was supposed to come with more food, but the side dishes were very weak. Bland meat. A chorizo ​​steak, a rib and five drinks, 240 reais.\n",

      "Typical Chinese restaurant, with a pleasant atmosphere and fast service, is ideal for lovers of Chinese food. The dishes are characterized by being quite hearty. The barge can serve well up to 5 people. It is worth it for those who enjoy Chinese food!\n",

      "We ordered a pizza to try the pork belly and it didn't please us at all, maybe we would have been happier with Carbobara. We risked the drinks, but there was a lot of elaboration to justify the price of gastrobar. For example: zagga mule (R $ 32) does not use ginger siphon foam, but egg white. Gin drinks are above average even for a gastrobar (40 to R $ 54). Drinks that pleased were Zaggaraio (R $ 35) and Canequinha (R $ 22).In summary, it was not worth the experience, perhaps the risky wine entrances would have been better, but nearby houses deliver more for less.\n",
      "Super high-spirited and cozy place in Porto Alegre. It is very well located, in a super busy and trendy street. Well served, first class service. I highly recommend it. Arrive early.\n",
      "Paris 6 arrived with a lot of prestige in BH, raising a lot of expectations. I went to dinner with my wife to enjoy a French bistro. I have been to many bistros in Paris and I like the type of food in these restaurants. The decor of Paris 6 is really cool, recreating the retro atmosphere of an authentic bistro. But the food !!!! What bad food. Unseasoned, cold, worse than mediocre. I ordered a confit of duck thigh and a small thigh, dry and with the taste of reheated. My wife ordered a sesame-crusted tuna and the tuna half came frozen with an unpalatable taste. It is a really bad restaurant. A feather.\n",
      "It starts with the excellent atmosphere of the place, very good service, wine list even better, and the dishes that are served there are of good taste and an unusual originality! Super recommend\n",
      "The house changed its address and is wider, more comfortable to move, with several screens transmitting clips and games, the service is fast, however I found the service of the waitress very dry and the same (common habit in Gyn's bars), I removed the glass on the table even though I still have a drink ... I particularly find it boring, the bar wins with consumption, however, there must be patience for people to have their drink until the end ..., be aware of any need or the table with empty glasses and plates, or signaling the end of the drink or meal is one thing, withdrawing from the conversation without even asking permission is rude ... It is still one of the most popular and frequented in the city. Worth the visit.\n",
      "The pastry is very dry and the dough is crunchy. The chocolate one is delicious. Pleasant and familiar place. The price is good, starting at R $ 6.00, small, as they divide into small, medium and large.\n",
      "Very pleasant, cozy atmosphere, full of details, good soundtrack, good acoustics, you can talk quietly, and the food is good.\n"

Impeccable service, with the congratulations team!It is next to a terrace with a beautiful view of the lagoon.And the food ... very good! We ordered a delicious toast of jamon with starters. The whole portion brings two toasts well served. Mainly, the house paella, with only seafood, was very tasty but the highlight is the cod. We went for cod on wood, well served and delicious. To close, churros with dulce de leche, with light pasta and a perfect dulce de leche.It is not a cheap restaurant, but the price is justified by the quality of the products.To repeat!\n",
      "It has a great rotation, with a good price and a lot of variety. Fridays are usually more crowded and the service can leave something to be desired.\n",

      "The food is very good. You can kill the longing for a good acarajé over there. However, the upset is irritating. There was only one waiter to serve over 12 occupied tables. It gets to constrict the customer because how to complain about a waiter who has to serve so many people? The problem is not with the waiter but with the establishment. Anyway, all orders took too long. We arrived at 13h and left at 16h. So, if you have enough patience, it's worth the visit!\n",
      "Excellent Japanese restaurant. Best in class! We were very well attended and the food is very good. Varied and complete menu even in the traditional carvery option. Family atmosphere and everything very new and modern. I recommend it and will be back more often with family and friends.\n",
      "The place is very beautiful and well located. Service is very good too. I thought the fresh pasta menu could have more options. My husband who opted for grilled chicken found the dish to be normal. My cannelloni was good. Maybe I would come back to try the pizzas that we are very beautiful and smelling.\n",
      "Very good food, excellent service. Top quality ingredients and came out at an ideal time.\n",
      "Very reasonable restaurant. Good food, regular service and pleasant atmosphere, better at night.They are always at major events in the city, showing their cuisine, at the Carnival in Bairro do Recife, for example.\n",

      "Very good meats, but the dishes are small for two people (when ordering like this) and there is also a sensational price tag. Worth to know, eat well, but it is expensive for what it offers.\n",
      "When I got there it was packed, but in a short time I was able to sit. I found the flavors unattractive and the taste was not the one I appreciated the most. The pizzas are good, but nothing worth returning to.\n",
      "Wonderful food! It is worth asking for seafood, as well as fresh, the price is affordable. Cozy atmosphere, attentive waiters and the food does not take long to arrive.It is also worthwhile to try the different dessert options, as they are affordable and give more than one person to eat.Be sure to visit this restaurant with high gastronomy and affordable price when going to Natal.\n",
      "Varied salad buffet among several other delicious things like coxinha, pastries, fried plantains.The barbecue buffet is very good, always fresh and tasty and the dessert buffet leaves nothing to be desired.The service is great and fast for those who want to have lunch without wasting a lot of time, but the place is not so big and the checkout line is always long.\n",
      "The restaurant has an Italian based menu, but the atmosphere is modern, colorful, the waiters are friendly and responsive. The smell of pizza perfumes the place, the food is wonderful, the prices are consistent and the orders are delivered quickly. The negative point is only because it is an informal environment, people talk loudly, noisy. But in no way detracts from the place.\n",

      "New Dish of the day served every day ... Healthy organic and healthy! Affordable as well. fresh juices and a full meal with fifteen reils salad.Very simple place\n",
      "We came for Father's Day lunch.The service is good, the starters (empanadas, sliced ​​chorizo ​​and sausage) are very good.We ordered the steaks for 2 people. As we frequent other parrillas, like Argentina, Pobre Juan etc, I thought the chorizo ​​steak would come as we always eat here and outside the country = high cut. To our surprise, the chorizo ​​and ancho cuts for 2 are extremely thin, taking away all the excitement of the image that we already had on our heads when ordering parrilla meat. We always imagine high cuts, with a cold crust and red interior. Nothing like that. The meat comes thin like the one we make at home in the frying pan. Less bad because the taste is good. But, we know that, according to the way we cut, the meat changes the flavor.If you are going to visit this restaurant, order the meat with high steak. It gave the impression that they caught half chorizo ​​and even cut in half horizontally and charged a price of 2.\n"

But from what I see when I pass the region, the restaurant is usually very crowded during the weekend.The atmosphere was very good, with live music and very nice the show they do to show the preparation of the dishes.We tried an Arancini that was excellent and a Ravioli Pomodoro that was good, but I believe that anyone in this restaurant should try the Ao Formmagio dishes that seem to be better.\n",
      "Well located in Ponta Negra. The service stands out, as well as the full and tasty dishes. I recommend!\n",
      "Good restaurant with varieties in typical dishes of Portuguese cuisine. Good wines with affordable prices. Good quality waiter service. The only observation is that the bill in any restaurant should have the addition of 10% of services. We know this is optional but the presence on the account causes an embarrassment in the relationship between the waiter and the customer.\n",
      "Last time I was positively surprised by the onion. Always oily, this time it was drier. The rib, as always, very good. I don't remember the name of the dessert, but I recommend it too (and you can share it with 2 or 3 people, quietly).\n",

      "Very pleasant location and atmosphere - give preference to tables in the indoor area that is air conditioned. Reasonable service but it was fast. The pizza is very good - thin crust and varied (and quality) flavors. However, everything was very salty (I believe it was the sauce used in the pizzas). Good price.\n",
      "Great place great atmosphere but service leaves something to be desired lack of training and sometimes a waiter with a joke nothing to do!\n",
      "It's in the Burguer Fest season and they have a R $ 65.00 hamburger that has tartar and meat. Two portions of tartar, cold, and in the middle the hot meat. It turns out that the hot meat was not hot enough and the whole hamburger went cold. There had to be contrast and it got weird. The final result was not good. Then a chocolate that was sweet, soooo sweet, sickening.\n",
      "Excellent service (by the waiter Claudemir), food, leisure for the children and delicious drinks. I recommend!\n",
      "I thought it was dishonest to sell a glass under the pretext of tasting, they offer you a tasting but they serve and charge the glass, I did not intend to drink on the spot, I just wanted to buy a bottle to take away\n",
      "If you want fresh seafood I recommend Casa do Mar. The restaurant and fish market is located in a working class fishermen neighborhood. Casa Do Mar supplies fish to hotels and restaurants in the area. The fish market has a good menu, but the advantage is that the small kitchen will prepare the food to your liking. If you want bread, ask for it, the desert available only to excellent fresh fish. I had the pleasenty fruit spaghetti spiced with Marinara sauce in one. It was amazing.The local cold beer was very good and their coffee is excellent.The restaurant is located near the coast after the high end buildings and the fishing village begins. I recommend taking a taxi. Taxis pass frequently and you should have no problem finding one. This is not a neighborhood for the tourist to venture out on foot, but very worth it if you like seafood.\n",

      "The restaurant has two types of service, a la carte and carvery. I found the carvery a little expensive (R $ 71.00 per person). A la carte dishes cost between 81 and 100 reais and serve two people well, especially because they are accompanied by a free salad buffet and some hot dishes. We tried and indicated the pacu rib that we accompanied with a pirão de pintado served from the buffet. Our total expense, between four people, was R $ 220.00, with two juices, a soft drink and a dessert (ice cream tempura at R $ 21.90).\n",

Eaten tasty and plentiful. Good price and equally satisfactory service. It is further away from the city center, but easily located. Liked it.\n",
      "Good variety of typical northeastern food. The dishes are tasty and not heavy despite the style of the food. There is also the option of a very varied afternoon coffee. Whenever I go to João Pessoa I go there. In my opinion the restaurant was already better, but it is still worth the visit. Best cashew juice ever!\n",

It is a place that serves very well those who want to eat healthy and fatter foods, like the wonderful burger my husband ordered.Only compliments !! ❤️\n",

      "Although it is a traditional and extremely well known restaurant in BH, unfortunately I did not have a good impression. I say this because, when ordering a filet called Novo Sul, which on the extensive menu was accompanied with rice with raisins and pear puree, I received a dish with mashed potatoes.Until then it seemed like a simple mistake, although a plate of rice, potato straw and mashed potatoes is somewhat loaded with carbohydrates.When I asked the attendant about the pear puree, I received the following answer: Look at the pear there! - mentioning that some lint of pear were submerged in the mashed potatoes.I realized that it would not be worth complaining and spoiling lunch, but I confess that it made me uncomfortable.In general, the restaurant needs to be updated: service, menu and presentation of dishes.\n",

But there are very varied options for all tastes.It is a great option for a self-service restaurant.Try tapioca with dulce de leche, rennet cheese and bananas that come in the shape of a cactus ... it's divine !!!\n",
      "I ate a dish with Aratu, it was very good. The location is very good but the prices are NOT inviting.\n",
      "The food itself is very good, but at lunchtime at least every time I went, they are not able to refill the steak. Often food is lacking and we have to wait, especially the chicken that should be the main attraction of the house, often due to the demand it ends up being rare or almost raw ... except for that, the taste is great.\n",
      "I booked the table for Valentine's Day dinner 2 days in advance and paid the 50 reais for the table reservation as requested. Upon arriving at the bar we were seated on a sofa and said that this was our table! How are we supposed to have dinner on a couch without a table ?! We asked to change took 10 minutes and sat us at a super tight table where we were left unattended for another 10 minutes. They clearly wanted to profit from Valentine's Day and had no structure !! Bad experience !! We got up and left.\n",

      "From what it seems to me, the owners and management care little about the training and experience of their waiters .. I went with a group of friends on Friday and only disappointment, long service, simple drinks like coca cola and draft beer take too long to come waiters break their heads with orders, an açaí went down without asking, total inattention of the waitresses who do not have a posture in the restaurant and what is worse, on other occasions I went to Mormaii da JK last year when I was well attended I realized that the waiters good ones are no longer there, so apparently there is something wrong with adm / management, I recommend Mormaii do Pontão or Brasília Shopping, it doesn't get to be top of the line in service but it is much better than JK's.Note: Owner does not respond to any complaints here from his customers other than large bars and restaurants like Coco Bambu.\n",

      "We went to see the famous Paris 6. So far everything was great. I made a registration when we arrived, we didn't wait long, we were invited to sit down. After all, we are with our 5-month-old daughter and we got the preferred password. The house is beautiful as always and the service is not compatible. The waiter who answered us knew nothing of what we asked and everything asked for help from another colleague. We ordered some starter bruschettas, I recommend, very tasty and well seasoned. As soon as the entrance arrived, 13:00, we ordered the main course from the waiter. An hour and a half after much complaining, it finally arrived. My dish was Médaillons Chorão, it was without salt. I complained to the Maître and he told me that the chef made the dish this way, in case any customer with a pressure problem was not sick. He asked me to season at the table. I found his excuse excellent. My wife liked her dish but nothing that impressed, for dessert we ordered a creme brule, normal nothing special ... It may be that in a few months of a lot of training it may be worth returning but for the time being our impression was not good .\n",

      "I was used to going to this place. A friend introduced me and we always met there. The excellent food, the perfect service and the cozy atmosphere made it a must! But on my last time, unfortunately NOTHING pleased us! First, there is no place nearby to park, having to leave the car far away and subject to frequent burglaries in the region. Second, as we chose the bar for meeting friends, the main focus is conversation. How to talk in a place where the sound is loud? We asked (without exaggeration) a 10 times to lower the volume. It was no use, in the biggest wooden face they went there and increased! Third, there was a lady smoking on the sidewalk. I politely asked the waiter to come and talk to her, since I have an allergy to cigarette smoke. To no avail, we had to move to a table on the other side of the bar, since not only did the lady continue to smoke, but how EVERYONE at her table started! The waiter still spent more than half an hour talking to the smoker on the sidewalk (he must have been a friend of hers or even a client older than me). And lastly the food! We ordered skewers (great by the way) and 3 gororobas (beans, meat, cream and cheese au gratin). Terrible! Without salt, very greasy and with the taste and smell of burning, since a torch was used to brown the cheese on top and it didn't have a very good effect! Because I am treated like a clown, I will never come back, let alone indicate the place to anyone! The verdict was said by everyone at the table, it's not just my opinion! It's a shame, I liked everything there!\n"

But, to our disappointment they are no longer useful! We questioned and said that the cost to pass it on to customers was too high! But I think they should continue to offer it, because a Fasano-level restaurant manages to maintain these costs and the people who frequent it certainly have the purchasing power to pay for it. Well, then we ordered a King crab salad, a shame but it did not meet our expectations, it was tasteless and what predominated was lettuce. Good thing that the main dish of veal with white truffles erased the taste of the starter, it was divine, wonderful! Perfect! The service continues as always very good as well as the wine list!\n",
      "I had lunch with the family on a Sunday and we ordered a capixaba moqueca for two people R $ 60.00. It was delicious and served three people very well. The service was reasonable. The only problem was with the juice variety, it had only been pineapple. According to the waiter, the orange and lemon was over. I found the establishment a little unprepared.\n",
      "After working out at Parcão or Praça da Encol, you can enjoy a delicious natural fruit juice or a smoothie outdoors. Various combinations of flavors. But be prepared to wait in line due to the demand on hot days .... There are also other options on the menu such as sandwiches / Wraps, açaí, etc. It is worth checking. I recommend !\n",
      "regional food diversified and with very strong seasoning. great! but the price of the kilo is a little high!\n",
      "The last time I came here, two years ago, it gave me a very good nostalgia from the Nikkei era, fresh food, typical Japanese dishes ... but yesterday I came back and found it very good. Too bad, the fish were dry, it was not at all proud. It was so bad, I didn't even eat the extra portion of wild salmon, which they ended up kindly not charging. I ordered jasmine tea and it was bag tea, what a pity. I'll give it a little more time before I give up for good.\n",
      "Attendance for how many of the waiters was bad, I raised my hands and nobody looked, I asked for a coke I only took when the bill arrived, everyone looking at everything but you. . .The good food, meat options sometimes very rare, even raw, for such a famous restaurant I found it very overrated by what they say. . .\n",
      "Wonderful regional restaurant that never disappoints. Since 2013 all air conditioned and still has a divine bakery. One of the best desserts in the city: coco zoião.\n",
      "The food is very good, we ordered one there a minute, simple but plentiful and considering that with R $ 20.00 it served two people it can be said that it was very cheap.It can improve the bathroom of the place, but I think customers should do their part.\n",
      "Great food. Friendly service, I confess that I expected more from the environment, but it was not a disappointment. It's worth it, I recommend it.\n",
      "Situated in Largo Zumbi dos Palmares, it has the highest point in the parking lot that is in front.The tables and chairs are uncomfortable and are very close together, making it difficult even for the service that is still good.The climate is reasonable but the place is very humid.WiFi is password-free but very slow.The noise level in the environment is very high.The toilets are very simple and without care with cleaning and with an aggravation of the male being located on the upper floor with access by narrow stairway.The beer list is reasonable but with high prices and the wine list has 38 items with prices ranging from R $ 10.00 (glass) to R $ 87.09 (Andeluna Malbec Argentino).Pizza prices are: individual R $ 29.90, 1/4 meter R $ 44.90 and 1/2 meter R $ 69.90.The dough is high and comes close to the one made at home without resting the dough is served with a temperature of 48 degrees and still with the stone with a temperature around 70 degrees and therefore without the ability to maintain the temperature suitable for consumption.The prices are high for what is offered but the company works with a discount site and hence the prices are adequate, which I think is unfair because mine in the case I paid the high price since I did not check before and did not print the ticket that would give me the discount .Bad cost x benefit.\n",
      "I loved the international prawn, perfect caipirosca. I loved it. The service. Appreciate. The whole team, especially Garcom Souza. Restaurant. Perfect.\n",
      "The orders really take a little while and the price is a little high, but the atmosphere is very pleasant and the hamburger was really delicious.\n",
      "The best of all in Orla, excellent gastronomy, local food, comfortable, beautiful view and location, and good price\n",
      "I want to congratulate the breakfast team, we arrived exhausted from a long night at work, and we were surprised by the service. Mr. Marcos, who I believe to be the team leader, is prompt, always on the lookout and ahead of customers' needs, always on the alert but in a light, humble and gentle way! The A plus was in the details: The staff served warm cheese bread on the tables .. complaining about the lack of oatmeal, a special dish was prepared on the spot!\n",
      "Want to eat a great pastry and go to an air-conditioned place with a place for children to play this is the right option.\n",
      "Excellent option for lunch. Varied and good buffet and excellent barbecue at a fair price. One of the best value for money in Palmas!\n",
      "Very good restaurant, with a vast menu and moderately priced. We ate spaghetti with pesto, perfect, highly recommended. We were attended by Cristiano Freitas, he was extremely attentive and kind, a show of service.\n",
      "The drink list is great, the food and snacks and hamburger too!For those who like beer (I don't like it) there is a tasting rule. I ate the spaghetti with seafood and sparkling wine, and it was great!\n",
      "We had 4 bad and tasteless experiences and never came back.Despite the reasonable price, the house has been losing its customer movement from the beginning.\n",
      "Sometimes people are kind of boring ...Reading one thing or another I thought we weren't talking about the same place, some of them in a bad mood 😬The place is a delight, in all aspects !!! The first contact was when making the reservation by phone and I was very well attended, Josélia, you were great! Attentive from the first moment, thank you.❤️The place provides various environments, indoor or outdoor, it is cozy, romantic, for the family, business etc. I don't remember being served so well in a restaurant in Brasilia, or in any other city, the treatment was excellent !!!! And in particular, Hendrik, Josélia and Márcio, you already have a captive place in our hearts. Exceptional professionals !!! With a reflection of great people, thank you for contributing to a wonderful evening!The food was amazing, we ordered the Filet Dijon which was spectacular, like everything served to us; all to the sound of a piano that needs no comment.Incredible place! Super recommend !!!! 😍Cris C.\n",

      "I tried Chiclete ... tasty, but they could put more shrimp and less cheese (a lot of cheese!)Other dishes like the breaded shrimp looked good.The problem is the service. Too slow ... the wait is too long for the drink, food, expect to arrive ...\n",
      "Great place .... very good service with very friendly and helpful people. Great food at a fair price. I will definitely return numerous times. Wonderful!!!!\n",
      "I do not believe that residents of RJ still eat at this steakhouse. There are several better options with carvery, such as ground fire or those who like to eat well without being carvery, there is Malta, Brazier which are 100 times better.My last experience was decadent.\n",

      "Perfect!!! The meals we had there were fantastic !! Great service, great seasoning !!! It was amazing!!!\n",
      "Located in a quiet street, the experience at Raibu begins when you arrive at the place. With two separate environments, the person can choose to stay inside or outside the hall.My fiancé and I chose outside, with the waiter already arriving with the menus and offering us something to drink.As we prefer to stay with the sequence, the service soon started: first a sunomono, followed by two different types of hot philadelphia and with salmon tataki on top. In the sequence, came two plates of sushis and varied sashimis, besides the crunchy and well stuffed dumplings (Below some photos of the dishes!).All dishes can be repeated at the end of the sequence.Everything was served with great agility, cordiality on the part of the waiters and an extra care of the sushiman with both the pieces and the presentation and, of course, the flavor!The sequence costs 129 reais and is worth every penny. For those who have Best Gourmet, a couple pays only one set or two couples pay two.Excellent Japanese option for those who want to go with friends or as a couple!\n",
      "A great steakhouse, many varieties of meat, pleasant and comfortable space and great service.\n",
      "Regional restaurant that follows the line of the others, works in a buffet scheme, has good variety and note the caprice dispensed in the preparation of food, the flavors are varied and the seasoning is the same. The atmosphere is decorated with regional items and the price is according to what is served. The service is friendly and the location of the restaurant is good, in one of the main avenues of the city.\n",
      "Typical gaucho food, with regional dances.The food is very good. Picanha, diversified meats (sheep, cattle, pork, chicken), which have a special seasoning. It looks like we're having lunch at home. Still, including bread with very tasty garlic. And to top it off there is a variety of salads, with a tasty mayonnaise, and other hot dishes.As for the dances, the group was very talented. A show!\n",
      "All my experiences in this restaurant were wonderful. All the options I had the pleasure of tasting were wonderful. Sensational the shrimp risotto, like the pasta with black truffles, which is not normally on the menu, but on request you can order, are of the gods. Cozy restaurant and decoration with paintings from different regions of Italy. Chef Paolo is always kind and friendly, visiting the tables, making suggestions and taking questions from customers. He offers good wine options, but the customer can also pay for the cork stopper. I recommend this restaurant without fear of making mistakes.\n",
      "Whenever the weather cools a little, Bon warms up with the creams of the day, always accompanied by bruschetas and breads. I tried the carrot and loved it.\n",
      "It is already the third time in this intimate restaurant. Curious and very good cuisine. We always ask for the tasting menu and it is very worthwhile (the 5 course 270 per person and the complete 7 or 8 courses for around R $ 410). The dishes are well prepared and really Gourmets. I recommend it to anyone who wants to taste the dishes.\n",
      "The restaurant besides having a great location and an incredible variety and dishes, give a pizza to a risotto or pf and everything is very tasty. I spent my honeymoon in Maceió and had dinner at least three nights at Parmegiano. The service was great they are all very polite, I really liked it and recommend it.\n",
      "Excellent food, cozy atmosphere and great service. Certainly, when I return to Maceió, I will go again.\n",

      "We went to the restaurant last year and we really like crab. This time, we ordered crab again, in addition to pirão, broth and fish cakes.The dishes are well served and the price is very good: the broth and the pirão were good, on the other hand the crabs were bad and without seasoning, black / dirty with mud, and the dumplings only had almost potatoes, in addition to raw and without seasoning .The service is attentive, although the kitchen work is slow. The long wait was worth the coconut water.Parking and spacious, but not suitable for children, although there is a slide at the entrance.The place didn't seem clean: very dirty windows, tables and bathrooms.\n",
      "Very good food! Dishes well served! I recommend! Always very busy, try to arrive early. It has a toy library but without supervision!\n",
      "I wonder if a chef really has to follow the gastronomic news! And I always have the impression that chef Ivo is one of the best traditional chefs in Brazil today.I think I will continue to wonder if modern cuisine is worth it, or if it is worth traveling decades ago and being able to enjoy as much flavor as there is in the dishes served in this restaurant.Congratulations to everyone involved.\n",
      "The products used are of quality. I didn't like the pasta, I found it dry and hard. Beneficial cost is good. The order comes out very fast. Excellent skydiving is in a hurry.\n",

      "The restaurant is very well located in Lapa, it is at the beginning of the way up Muratori Street. The service is ok.The food options are: pizzas, chips and pork ribs.The pizzas are great, with thin and crunchy dough and variety of flavors. The day I went to eat the ribs, they were not good, so I would not recommend it.French fries are perfect, be sure to eat.\n",
      "Restaurant with excellent cost-benefit, which is concerned with healthy eating without losing the focus of the food being tasty and quality. It offers a variety of natural juices of different combinations such as carrot + orange, green juice, coconut + cupuaçu, watermelon + lemon. In addition to having a very cool loyalty program. Restaurant note 10!\n"

      "Many years ago, as soon as it opened, I was at Habib's store in Pituba and my wife was a victim of theft. I managed to discover the author and recovered the wallet on my own, even though I alerted the security guard and the manager of what happened. After that, at the insistence of the children, I went a few times and never had a good experience.The staff are poorly prepared, the time taken for the dishes is enormous (I don't know why it is called fast food), the atmosphere is dirty, old and ugly (maybe it will change after the renovation in progress) and the dishes taste horrible (I have already eaten in other places) chain stores and I know that this is not the standard). Last Sunday, again at the request of the children, I went again, this time at the drive thru and to my surprise (or not) I waited almost 20 min in line after placing the order.\n",

      "It cooks more in the French style even in quantities. Good food, well prepared by Ivo Faria. Some dishes do not please. Personal taste. Prepare the pocket. I recommend the La Palma restaurant. I was told I belong to the family and it has a better price.\n",
      "Visiting Alemão's bar is very good. The food is amazing and the service is good. Varied dishes like the wonderful jaguar meat where I've never eaten another. I highly recommend it.\n",

      "Great food. Cost-effective executive lunch very good. Only 29 reais per starter, main course and dessert. Also very good service.\n",
      "The disadvantage of the place is its location, as it is not so privileged in the city, but it is close to the access to BR, so for those who are passing by the access point (traveling), it is worth a stop.\n",
      "The local cuisine is excellent, but nothing compares to the menu and combinations that this restaurant was able to provide. These are dishes that make us groan with pleasure! I indicate the tambaqui band - it's not like the others! - which comes with a grilled cassava tree that is to be prayed for ....\n",
      "great service and delicious dinner.wonderful place to drink good wines. I didn't see the famous cod.\n",
      "I have known the restaurant for many years but I stopped attending it because I am not in the region. Now in December 2014 I had lunch and was surprised by the buffet per kilo because they are common in Arabic food in many restaurants, for example an artichoke background filled with meat, pumpkin kibe. Congratulations to them and I hope to return more often!\n",
      "The place is charming, cool and you really feel you belong to the capital of São Paulo here. Both the drinks and the dishes are incredibly delicious and I don't imagine that anything can take away the feeling of a great experience on site. Even on rainy days like the one I went to, it is possible to admire the beautiful view that the roof of the famous Hotel Unique provides, to delight with the crab cone and the most different types of food specialties gathered in one place. Dessert is no less important, so reserve a place for it and enjoy the space, where you can often see your chef Emanuel Bassoleil, circling. Book some money, reserve a table and go enjoy it!\n",
      "Super nice and air-conditioned environment, several salad options, first class service, with several gastronomic options, certainly worth visiting\n",
      "The undergound is an interesting bar / pub, with rocker decor, which makes the place stylish. Well attended. The admission price was very inviting, as well as the price of drinks are also great value for money, compared to other places in the city. Sunday night had Karaoke with live band (great balcony!) Which guarantees excitement all night. Ah, the underground lives up to its name, as it is below the surface, which leaves it really a little hidden.\n",
      "Very good Mexican restaurant located near Paulista. Always very crowded and with new drink options like frozen mojito.\n",
      "Cozy restaurant, with varied and very tasty dishes. The decoration of the place is another differential.\n",

      "I was not satisfied with the quality of the food. a lot of variety, but the quality drops, considering the quantity that is made. I won't be returning. the service is reasonable. few waiters to serve.\n",
      "The boneless chicken is delicious, the best I've ever tasted and the side dishes are also delicious! The environment leaves something to be desired as it does not have air conditioning and the heat is more intense due to the barbecue.\n",

Even during the week, I went before noon and the restaurant was full.\n",
      "A pleasant surprise in Porto Alegre. Super nice atmosphere bar (even if there is no Radio Gaúcha event on the day), with good bar food and great service. It just didn't score 10 because my hamburger was a little dry, but tasty. The snacks (caramelized onion, fried cassava, french fries) were great, and the dark draft beer was excellent. I'll be back here when I'm in town.\n",

The guitarist played and sang Pink Floyd and Zé Ramalho, MPB and national rock, flaskbacks and current songs. Very cool! Lunch is self-service, but I went in the evening, Thursday before Holy Week.\n"

I found it interesting because I prefer sugar free. Feijoada day, a Wednesday, but there were other options, so much so that I preferred to get a grilled chicken fillet, which by the way was very spicy and tasty.

      "Great self-service restaurant, with a rich and delicious buffet, in a pleasant and convenient location next to Parque da Redenção. In addition to the large lounge, you can also choose outdoor tables in the park, which is always my preference. On weekends there may be a queue. The single price is very convenient because we can serve ourselves at will and as often as we like; desserts included. The only risk is overeating, as there is a wide variety and everything is very tasty!\n",

      "Macaxeira has the strong points of food and caipirinhas, I recommend the yellow fruit. The manioc chips and torresminho are worth the entrance.

      "Extremely pleasant restaurant in an old renovated house in Humaitá. The place has small spaces and allows reservations only at the first time - 20: 00h (excellent idea!). At the entrance, there is an option for an informal environment and at the back of the house, an option for a more refined environment. To reach the second environment, you must cross a corridor and you can have a view of the bar and the kitchen, in sequence, through the windows of the house. The drinks are very interesting, with different mixes than what is found in other restaurants. The menu is small, but I'm sure you will be in doubt among several options. Starters and main dishes are prepared and served as the costume requires. Don't expect portions to share. The wine list is also small, but manages to please all palates. Negative points: only 3 dessert options and the appearance of the menus that are made on a simple sheet of cardboard. The staff is attentive. It has a valet system.\n",
      "Surprise to go to Galetos and eat a wonderful steak. Great restaurant, with good service and fair price. I loved the salad buffet and the airier atmosphere than other restaurants. You can eat quietly without much noise.\n",
      "The restaurant wins for the promotions of food and drink doubled, and also for the location. I always go on Thursday or Saturday, which has double shrimp. on the fifth, the draft beer, caipirosca and kibe are also doubled. Like most establishments in Salvador, it sins for service. you need to be lucky enough to be served by an attentive waiter, or else beg them to look at you and beg for a drink. Anyway, it is a good option to go out, drink and eat with friends without paying a fortune, maaas, get ready for some setbacks.\n",
      "It's worth knowing but it's nothing big !!! The dishes are well prepared but could improve. The price is high for the presented. The draft beer is honest. Just it.\n",

On the first visit I suggest the Degustation Menu, which allows you to know a little of the wonderful menu. Prices are a little high, but worth every penny. I will be back many more times, for sure !!\n",
      "A very pleasant atmosphere with exquisite service, a typical canteen with tasty dishes from Italian, national, Cuban, etc ,,,. Pasta, meats (beef and chicken fillet), fish ... Delicious desserts. One thing that is lacking is the lack of exclusive parking, as it is located in a historic area of ​​Manaus, Praça da Polícia. Depending on the time, there are no nearby places available. But the sacrifice is worth it. I've been a customer for at least 30 years. There is a Fiorentina at Amazonas Shopping, practically with all the same qualities, but without the charm of being in front of a postcard of the city of Manaus.\n",
      "I frequented the restaurant from the beginning, and I was able to follow several phases of the restaurant. I can analyze that although the food has given a certain upgrade and has improved its taste, unfortunately there is still much to be changed, starting with the service. Honestly, I'm sorry to say (and I don't think there is a delicate way to say it), but the waiter who attended us had an unbelievable amount of bad. Every time he came to the table, I held my breath, because it was a bad odor. This gives the impression of poor hygiene. You really can't have a service like that. Nobody needs to smell like country roses, but that way is also difficult. Detail: it was not the first time that we were served by the same waiter. We even thought it was a thing of the day, but unfortunately we found that the stench still lingers - and it's been months from our visit until the last one now.The decoration / infrastructure has also improved, but I still find the stairs at the entrance very steep and dangerous as hell. I wonder how much they keep away customers with special needs or even older people who wouldn't face such a staircase.The presentation of the dishes also leaves a little to be desired. Samosas always look too oily, which is a shame. It didn't cost much to improve the zeal with this, after all, just let the oil drain and dry with paper towels.In addition, I really hope for the improvement of the quality of the restaurant in general, as it has everything to work out, but it leaves something to be desired in the items mentioned above.\n",

      "Years ago, when I was still in SP I told myself that I would never eat in America again. Being a hamburger lover, I have tried different restaurants in SP and this is the worst for the restaurant category that they think they are.My last trip from SP in November 2013 I was at Shopping Higienópolis and went downstairs to eat in the city cafeteria. As it was early for lunch (11:30 am) they were closed and I decided to give America another chance. How I regret it !!!Their hamburgers have a lot of sauce and mayonnaise (obviously the meat quality masquerade) which makes it difficult to eat. The meat was cold (how they managed to do it, I don't know). The juice I ordered has half the full frothy glass. All of this at an exorbitant price. The person sitting next to me didn't look happy, and left with half of his order on the plate.I really don't know why people still go to that place, is it a state of affairs ???\n",

To our surprise, at 2:45 pm, we were informed, while we were still eating, that the service had already ended. Complaining that it was a carvery and that we still wanted to eat other slices, the waiter, clearly embarrassed, said that the kitchen staff had already left.

It took them a long time to replace the drinks, we had to ask several times to bring the starter bread (yeah ...

Poorly made and cold food. Some had to ask to retrace the deadline. To top it off, they served everyone but the birthday boy's dish. The birthday boy's food (my food) only arrived after everyone had finished dinner. And the bill, a fortune, but a service worse than a tavern in central Brazil. I felt cheated, and when calling the manager, he did nothing. Don't risk it. Along with the bill for this unforgettable dinner that was so bad.\n"

      "Fine Italian food, very well attended and very cozy atmosphere! Great choice for a celebration for two together with a good wine.\n",
      "Excellent service, delicious food! Clean and pleasant place. Varied and tasty dishes! I recommend\n",
      "At Litoral Lanches you will find a menu with all the sandwiches named after beaches in Rio Grande do Norte, and one more delicious than the other. Juices are another attraction apart.\n",
      "Tasty food, excellent service especially to Lani who gave us special attention! Super recommend\n",
      "We need to be careful with trendy restaurants. Più came with a reputation disproportionate to its real size. The entrance of lychee with gorgonzola lacked gorgonzola to give the contrast. It just tasted like lychee. The two main courses, honestly, were not all that: the green lasagna came with a cheese crust (parmesan?) Which on the first fork looks great but on the second it gets tired. it gets sick. The half dry and not so succulent pork stinco disappoints. How boring !!!!\n",
      "The atmosphere is very pleasant, service well done and fast and the main thing, the food is delicious. Worth it!\n",
      "great atmosphere, clean place and good service. I recommend to stay in a very traditional place in Rio de Janeiro\n",
      "Fully corporate location, at least for lunch, inside a shopping center, very practical for those who occupy the hundreds of offices in the region. The price is average, good food and plenty. Very good for business lunch.\n",
      "The house termite is really good. In addition, the service is rated 10.(everything I wanted to write I already wrote, but as I need at least 100 characters, I'm writing these things in parentheses just to fill sausage).\n",
      "Fruits and vegetables are the main ingredients of this semi-natural restaurant. Fresh and light ingredients are used in a weighted buffet that offers flavor and variety, in addition to juices, sweets and pies, all made with natural ingredients. The facilities are charming: two rooms with soft and simple decor in a rustic masonry and wood house amidst beautiful gardens in a village on the Rio Vermelho. It has a Bahian souvenir shop and handicrafts. Good prices and family service led by Valmir, a nice gentleman, owner of the place.\n",
      "It's a nice way to get to know the flavors of Pará. The starters are delicious - highlighting the crab nail. The puppy is also tasty. Beers with local flavors are a good choice, as the microbrewery is in the same location. There are days when there is a happy hour with food and drink included at a reasonable price. And the good thing is at Estação das Doces, which already makes it possible to know other foods and stores.\n",
      "Loved the pizza! Innovative and very tasty. Worth a try. cold draft beer and very friendly attendants.\n",
      "good value for money, quality, traditional recommended for at least 30 years, did you decide on German cuisine? Bar da Lagoa is an excellent option ..\n",
      "Restaurant specializing in cuts of noble meats of excellent quality and unparalleled flavor as well as side dishes. It offers countless brands and types of artisanal beers for all tastes, as well as a wine list of different nationalities and grapes.Prices are generally steep for dishes that are not as well served.\n",
      "I must have been unlucky. I went to this restaurant based on the good testimonials here on Trip Advisor.The fish with vegetables was completely rubberized. Too bad of seasoning too. I couldn't point that out to anyone.The bill for the couple was quite salty even. We eat better for the same price or lower prices at other restaurants in Vitória.I must note that the very attentive waiter even said that he should have called him to, in the last case, make the dish change. Point for his service. I didn't think to do that. Just close the account and go.\n",
      "A good bar to try the celebrated sandwiches ... I ordered a filet mignon and it was tasty, although the amount of meat sometimes makes it difficult to bite, lol.The Portuguese potato was delicious, dry and crispy.Nice place with parking.Reasonable prices.\n",
      "Very welcoming place, excellent service and with a wide variety of menus, especially fish, which is a delight! very peaceful and familiar place. At night it has a very romantic atmosphere. show!\n"

      "I love this place and my kids too. It has an interesting playroom. We can eat quietly, in no hurry to return home because of the children. The pizzas have very thin dough, the way I like it. A rich and varied wine cellar. I only find the self-service buffet of starters, by the kilo, very expensive. It is more affordable to order from the menu. In fact, the price is rather salty. But for those who want children, it pays off.\n",
      "I really enjoyed the wonderful seasoning restaurant !!! I went overnight, crowded, for the service, the location and the quality!Highly recommend.\n",
      "The restaurant certainly draws attention for its tradition. Characterized staff and thematic decoration give a pleasant atmosphere to the environment. The moqueca is the specialty of the house and is very worthwhile. The prices in general are higher than the average, but it is worth it for those who want to visit a restaurant that offers typical Bahian cuisine with a little refinement.\n",
      "Good range of pizzas and pastas. They prepare a delicious white pizza. It also has a cold beer.\n",
      "As the restaurant is open until late at night, it is a good place to go after the party and is also a good cost benefit, since a dish can usually be divided between two people and is not usually very expensive. In addition, it has good service and most waiters have been working at the house for many years and despite the restaurant being one of the oldest houses in Belém, it has never dropped the service in terms of quality. However, they sin in the sense of waiting in line, since they do not make a table reservation.\n",
      "I would like to register here my referral regarding the mormaii surf bar ponte jk, I went to the mormaii on 05/15/2016 at approximately 20 hours, at first we were well attended, upon entering I asked the waitress to check if she accepted the Ticket ) the girl checked the card's flag and went inside to check it back and came up with the answer that she would accept yes. ok We ate and we drank and when ordering dessert the first one came up fast but the other two took about 50 min to arrive after a long wear and tear asking all the waiters to check any more. that we said that if it wasn't ready, I didn't want it anymore. When asking for the bill came with one more dessert she took it out so far so good. At the time of paying a bill of more than 200 reais we were informed that he did not accept the Ticket (meal of the ticket) that the girl at the beginning said she accepted. A girl who looked like the manager of the establishment was the one who was charging did not want to create confusion and we paid otherwise. However, when asking her how she would do if I had only that card she said I don't know, I would have to pay more like that? where is the responsibility of that place? Such a renowned restaurant should provide better training to its employees. Everyone was unprepared and we were served by about 5 different waiters.Result: Poor SERVICELADY CONDUCT OF THE WOMAN WHO SAYS HER MANAGER.WE WILL NOT BE BACK.\n",
      "At Av Atlântica in Ipanema it is a great restaurant for lunch after the beach. Or also for snacking because it has potatoes with bacon and very good cheddar.\n",
      "At the time of hunger it is a good option. Self-service restaurant, reasonable food and barbecue. The price is reasonable. Customer service too.\n",
      "We had dinner there and ate very well, the meat came very quickly and the waiters were always willing to serve us\n",
      "Fogo de ground is in my opinion the best place to eat meat in são paulo.The salad table is simple, has some garnishes, but I always refuse.I think there, even for the price (which is expensive - the bill is at least R $ 140 per person) - you should eat meat, a lot of meat. Take the opportunity to try all the different types.My favorite: Shoulder Stake. I've never eaten anywhere else, and it's very good there!Service is fast and very efficient. Good for both business meetings and leisure.For those who like meat ....... you have to go at least once!\n",
      "I only have compliments, excellent food, perfect happy hour, tasteful music, a beachfront location in Meireles.\n",
      "Super cool, relaxed and beautiful place.Good service, and pizza, of course, very good.For those who like thin crust, this is the best.Tenderloin pizza with chutney suggestion.\n",
      "Nice place, good food and fair price. It is certainly a mandatory stop in the city center!\n",
      "Normal snack bar, normal sandwich, proportional to the amount charged, the environment needs more attention, more care when cleaning the tables. Being in one of the main tourist addresses in Fortaleza I expected more from the place.\n",
      "It is a small place, but it is very worth going. There are few options on the menu, but the ones you have are really good. There is always a different fruit water each month and all that I tried were very good. Beers also change and there are always different ones. The place accepts animals at the street tables and the attendants are always loved ones with the dogs. The service is good, they are very kind and helpful. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "We were at In House to have a wine, eat something, chat and relax after the work week. We ordered some starters, which are served in pairs. I recommend the Provencal octopus and the classic tomato with basil. There are also delicious dishes on the menu and I ordered shrimp carbonara, a delicious spaghetti with prawns in carbonara sauce. The suggested wine was Bom Juiz Alentejo DOC, an excellent choice.\n",
      "There are competitors. Even two are nearby, on the same avenue in Porcao. But nothing compares to the noble meat service at this establishment. Good selection of wines. Service request. Ample parking. Hot and cold buffet very well prepared. Portion still and Porcao. The best steakhouse in BH, for those who appreciate a differentiated meat service.\n",
      "Very pleasant atmosphere, but the dish I ordered, shrimp nau, was nothing special. The wine list is good, but prices are slightly above normal\n",
      "Yummy atmosphere, well-made food, a little salty price and unfortunately the service leaves much to be desired.\n",
      "We went to spend the weekend in SP and of course we could not fail to check out the famous Eataly.An incredible place for those who like gastronomy and gourmet products.Large, comfortable store many, but many product options of the most varied.The cellar is a highlight.Restaurants for all tastes.We chose to taste the famous pizza, and it was a great choice, we ordered pepperoni and la parma two delicacies.Thin dough, well baked, crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside, well stuffed, was delicious.After lunch it was inevitable not to do several shopping.Here is my recommendation and I want to go back and try the other options.\n",
      "I went twice and found the food to be great. We ordered the carvery, which is very varied. The pastas are delicious. The suckling pig with jelly is very good. The service is excellent. The atmosphere is also very good. It has on-site parking.\n",
      "Beautifully decorated restaurant, Excellent service! The food then .. totally deliciiiiiiiaaaaa, very good !!! I highly recommend it.\n",
      "A good restaurant, with a pleasant atmosphere, well located (Shopping RioMar), a good wine list. The service was already better, last visit left a little to be desired.\n",
      "Perfect restaurant, with very good service, wonderful food and in the right measure, all questions about the dishes were answered by the staff. Not to mention the desserts that are divine.\n",
      "Wonderful food, breaded onion the best I've ever eaten, a must-see rib in addition to the place being super nice, great for meeting friends, romantic dinner and to finish the dessert is wonderful\n",
      "Bakery that has a special touch, for the good bread options and an excellent menu of savory and sweet its savory and sweet.\n",
      "The restaurant is very good, a super nice and welcoming place, the price is a bit more salty and just for the service offered!\n",
      "Great service and a varied menu. Great for a happy hour with friends. It also has several options for breakfast. I already had lunch at the buffet but it didn't impress, but it also left something to be desired.\n",
      "We went to Natal at the beginning of March 2018. And several people referred us to tapiocaria.We went and were delighted with the service, cleanliness, organization and flavor.Tapioca is very well served, perhaps it is worth sharing one with someone, if you are interested in trying another flavor, as it is impossible to eat more than one.We were attended by Vanusa, and we were delighted with her.We love the place!\n"

      "The restaurant is simple but the quality of the barbecue is excellent. The best I've ever eaten in a restaurant of this type (choose a meat and 2 side dishes). The service is good and fast which makes it the best cost / benefit in the region. If you want good meat, fast and at a good price, this is the place. Suggestion: skewer of the house with varied salad and fried potatoes.\n",
      "Restaurant with pleasant atmosphere. Great live music. Excellent food and perfect service.Shimeji is impeccable. I recommend\n",
      "They didn't deliver the pizza I ordered. 2hs waiting. Ask elsewhere. Non-existent service. We call and no one answers. I know their pizza and it's pretty mediocre. My wife insisted and we are going through this now. Do not waste time with this establishment.\n",
      "The best place in Lapa to dance, have fun and flirt. Average admission price for other nightclubs in Rio, with excellent drinks and cold beers. Live music and DJ all night. Samba, pagode, forró and DJ with lively and dancing music.\n",
      "The beach club is on the hill of Pão de Açúcar, after a walk in the park of the hill Pão de Açúcar we come across this cafe !! Yummy, relaxed atmosphere with lounge music in the background! Chairs and armchairs arranged so that the view is favored! Very tasty place !! I recommend!!!\n",
      "has an incredible variety of very tasty chocolates, both national and imported. The price is affordable\n",
      "the variety is reasonable but very repetitive, the menu could vary as the flow of people at lunch is large. the strong point is the desserts.\n",
      "We have been well attended since arrival. House decorated with old objects and sometimes non sense and a menu with funny names, which are not lost by name, are seriously good. Starter: Good fried but slightly salty needle and coalho cheese, type express, arrived quickly at the table! For the dish we chose three-phase filet, a good piece of filet mignon stuffed with bacon and curd, finely accompanied by breaded banana, mushroom rice and straw manioc: All good phases! For dessert, skip the usual milk pudding and choose the drunk milk jam, with Port wine or Pernambucanissimo, roll cake with many layers, cream ice cream and goibada syrup. Fantastic!\n",
      "Good and varied food and, when I went, the weight. Friendly service, fair price and cozy regional atmosphere. But what enchanted me was the variety of natural juices. I tasted the red fruit and loved it: very tasty and, unlike other places, it was juice and not refreshment.\n",
      "1000 note service. Variety of options, great facilities. Search the hotel where you are staying. Good price. Dish recommended for 2 people, eat up to 4. Excellent, without a doubt.\n",
      "All the Coco Bambú I know are very good and this one, a dish I always ask for is international shrimp, it’s very worth it! great food!\n",

      "Food and service are excellent!Grade 10!The great location in Bairro 13 de Julho close to the viewpoint and the mall.\n",
      "Average steakhouse, few options of fine meat, does not serve angus, beautiful and pleasant atmosphere, good buffet table, but for the price they charge, it is not worth it. There are much better steakhouses in São Paulo\n",
      "Very well attended. I became a fan. The attendant Alessandra is a 100! Top food !! Goldfish is better than picanha!\n",
      "In addition to enjoying a beautiful location, the food is also great. The executive dish is very well served. the file mignon was wonderful! quindim, then, is not even mentioned!\n",
      "I preferred it when it was the old Nafuka, they had some very creative and different options on the menu, in general the quality of the food was better. Now it is just reasonable, making the cost x benefit not fair.I also did not like the dish rest with many advertisements, I polluted the table environment.The atmosphere of the restaurant remains the same, very pleasant, very well maintained. The service is also very good.\n",
      "The place is large and because of that large groups of friends are always there, at huge and noisy tables. In addition, live music on Saturdays in the afternoon contributes to the conversation being only in shouting. But the animation runs rampant, excited waiters, who can't see your empty plate that comes with another skewer.The variety is great and most of them very well done, I just found the sausage sickening and the mozzarella a little hard, but the others are worth it.\n",
      "Best kiosk I've ever seen on the beach! Very good! I recommend it for the whole family, from the child to the adult. There is a swimming pool inside the kiosk.\n",

      "A great option of healthy food for those who want to have a quick meal inside the Shopping da Gávea. The restaurant is in a cozy corner of the mall and it is nice to eat watching people go by. The owners are very present and guarantee the quality of the service.\n",
      "I liked this restaurant, the meat buffet is wonderful and the desserts are delicious. They have the best steak in town.\n",

Maximum evaluation in relation to meat quality!However, it was not the first time that the restaurant was with a group of Asian people totally drunk. They didn't stop pissing. Female and male bathrooms all vomited !! They cleaned up quickly but it was still unpleasant, after all I was there with a visitor from outside! In the end, one of the drunks fell so high!It was clearly seen that the restaurant prioritizes selling one bottle of wine after another, doing the big deal of the day, instead of preserving the environment for other customers! Feather!\n",
      "The atmosphere is super pleasant, with creative decor and full of bossa! The service is great, with unique and delicious dishes! I really like the starters and salads! An excellent choice are the caipirowskas of: Kiwi, tangerine and strawberry! A great cellar too! For those who enjoy dessert, it's worth checking out!\n",
      "The restaurant has a vegan menu that leaves nothing to be desired, there are several options for starters, three different hamburgers and desserts! The service is great and the food doesn't take long to arrive. I strongly recommend the funghi burger with peas, the best burger I've ever eaten (vegetarian or not). The atmosphere is very pleasant. The price is a little expensive, but nothing absurd.\n",
      "Very beautiful place, with rustic outdoor tables. I ordered a sausage sandwich. Yummy homemade bread, good ingredients, even the ketchup has the chef's signature. However, the result is only good, given the prices. Good and friendly service. I recommend it, but it can still improve.\n",
      "Nice atmosphere, very cold beer (very positive point).Very good snacks. On the day I went there was a trio pé de serra, which perfectly matched the decor of the place!\n",

      "The atmosphere is very nice and is the biggest highlight in the place. Service, also very good. The cuisine, which was the greatest expectation, if it did not disappoint, also did not excite. Yummy, no doubt, but without the extra I expected. Worth the visit and possibly the return, but without the excitement of the experimentation.\n",
      "Go and order the menu with the sun beef steaks. It is very worthwhile, as they are first class meat. the water farofa is delicious and their paçoca (meat) is also good.\n",
      "Exclusive creations, great flavor, brand new fish. I recommend the lunch combo that besides the super attractive price is a delight!\n",
      "Pleasant, romantic atmosphere and very interesting decor. Delicious food, with affordable price. Good and fast service. Worth knowing.\n",
      "It is very worth going! Typical Rio dance bar in the neighborhood of Lapa in Rio! Great snacks, the house is very nice with its period decoration and its typical museum furniture! 4 floors of pure samba!\n"

      "We visited this house to taste some snacks accompanied by a good draft beer. The draft beer was served at the ideal temperature. In the menu there is a good offer of fuller beers, which I think are ideal for less hot days. The snacks, although they were good, did not surprise us in their taste. The amount of maximum restaurant reviews on Trip created a very high expectation that was not met. In the lounge there is a poster that informs you that the establishment provides filtered water free of charge. As I was very thirsty, to do a test I asked for a glass of water and they brought me a bottle of mineral water, which was charged to the bill. I paid and didn't even comment with the waiter. Perhaps I was not extremely clear in my request. Brazilian establishments have not yet created the custom of providing filtered water to customers' tables. Despite these small comments, the menu prices are not high, the atmosphere is very good and the neighborhood is the face of the Old River. Worth the visit to check it out!\n",
      "Excellent location, sea view, wonderful cheese pirao, delicious cassava, not to mention the perfect fillet of sun meat. Green beans in a unique potiguar way ... without cheese and without sour cream as Ceará likes but has its value and today I love it. Whenever I go to Natal, Mossoró or JP I go on the meat board.\n",
      "Great service and I was surprised by the taste! Very tasty, worth every penny. Being in Curitiba again I will certainly be savoring other options on the menu.\n",
      "A good space, super affordable menu with low prices, satisfactory portions, good music, cold drinks, snooker for fans. In the beginning it was smaller and more cozy with amber lighting for couples and very disputed, I got to stand at 1:30 in line to get a table, the romantic air was lost to make room for snooker players. The service is still good but it misses the time that was more intimate.\n",
      "Great service and delicious Italian cuisine. Very nice atmosphere, very romantic for couples, but also suitable for groups and families.\n",
      "It is a restaurant with good food, pleasant atmosphere, great service and a very nice price for the pocket and beautiful people.\n",
      "It is worth the experience, being close to my hotel, I had dinner for 2 days at Dom Churrasco, 1 day we ate shrimp the Mediterranean dish for 4 people, it is worth it and it really is for 4 people, the other day we took a mix of meats at tbm plate for 4 people and it was worth it both well served and very good food !!!!\n",

      "Very beautiful restaurant, polite and attentive waiters, we ordered a shrimp dish that was delicious, Lula's portion was also delicious. They should just put a note on the menu saying that the 10% of the service does not go on the card, which can sometimes be a problem if someone leaves home without money. But outside that is great.\n",
      "The food is delicious. The service is good but the dishes take a while to reach the table ... The environment needs a revitalization ...\n",
      "Concert hall that works only on Mondays, known for being the “second most lively in the world”. The atmosphere is very pleasant with beautiful decor. All the waiters dress in character and served us very well. The music plays all night with priority for forró pé de serra. I enjoyed meeting!\n",
      "I am a frequent visitor to the house in Recife and I have also been to Salvador - BA a few times, and I have always been extremely well attended and the food is of excellent quality. However, my experience at Cocobambu de Meireles did not live up to the quality of the chain. The service was extremely time consuming, even feeling a certain disregard on the part of the attendants. The dish also came very bad. I ordered a sun-dried meat with manioc (manioc) and to my surprise the meat was very hard and the manioc was undercooked. Unfortunately they missed the hand.\n",
      "I was always afraid of knowing Itiban because they told me that the price was absurd. In fact, nowadays it’s not even that expensive if you compare it to Zen, which has increased in price and declined considerably in service. The variety of sushi is the largest of any carvery I've ever been, and they are extremely delicious. Be sure to ask for the Dragon Ebi that has been on fire for your table. Sushi also comes in those boat trays.The only drawback is the space that is small which means a huge queue. The atmosphere is also not well decorated, but if you go to eat you will not care much about it.\n",

      "Nothing exceptional. Common pizza. Free shuttle service. The problem is being able to request a transfer. Cell phone in voicemail and landline directly occupied because they accept many requests by phone. We went on foot and returned by transfer.\n",
      "It is an excellent restaurant, with good food, pleasant space, a little slow service, but charismatic.\n",
      "It is a very traditional restaurant in Recife, and is located in Brasília Teimosa, near Pina. If you come from Boa Viagem you will pass through a rather narrow bridge, but the view is beautiful! In addition to the tasty food, I loved the service, the waiter was very kind and explained the entire menu, saying what was most requested and why. Prices are average, I think it's worth knowing.\n",
      "Traditional bar in the traditional Degrau restaurant! Try the breaded provolone! Relaxed place to meet friends in the late afternoon!\n",

      "Excellent restaurant at the standard level of the Outback chain. Very comfortable and equipped with efficient and friendly staff.\n",
      "When you look for healthy food outside the home and pay a high price for it, you expect a differential. This does not exist at the establishment. I have already tasted 3 dishes and none of them pleased me. All with ingredients easily found in supermarkets and without any house sauce or anything special.\n",
      "delicious hamburger, I ate Elis, sensational! `Congratulations to the house and to those who do the marvel!\n",

      "The food is good, well seasoned, offers a wide variety of hot and cold dishes at the buffet. Ideal for lunch during the week.\n",
      "In the fever of gourmet foods, Bife (excellent name) is a good option in Porto Alegre, with the charm of being in Bom Fim and with good beer options, such as Guinness. It's worth trying the rustic potatoes and the hamburgers with black bread.\n",
      "I went to lunch with a friend, quite unpretentiously. But it was a great surprise! On weekdays, at lunchtime, there is an executive menu of 39.90 that is super worth it! Starter + dish + dessert. Be sure to try the ceviche! Sensational!\n",
      "The house offers several types of dishes with a focus on cod, but also has other types of dishes (chicken and pasta) each day of the week has a dish on sale always accompanied by white rice.\n",
      "They charge 10% of service, unnecessary. The food is very good, a gastronomic experience, Fridays are the best day, because there are feijoada. There is no option of natural juices, nor a light / diet option.\n",
      "Very delicious food and very good atmosphere! The restaurant wins the clientele with an exaggerated offer of carbohydrates (Ex: rice and pasta), while the amount of meat / fish / fruits is not proportional. Go\n",
      "Simply wonderful food and service! The price is not that cheap (100 reais a carvery) but it is worth every penny!In addition to the meats, it has a cold and a seafood track! It even had lobster! Super attentive waiters! I recommend !\n",
      "Very friendly waiters! Charming atmosphere. And being able to take your wine without paying for the cork? Amazing! Food? Delicious. From the starter to the dessert. It lives crowded. And it deserves it. It's a really, really good restaurant.\n",
      "I went to the Kaamo restaurant with my family for dinner and everything was great! Reservation is required in advance. Wonderful service since arrival. Cozy atmosphere inside the Kenoa Resort. The dishes were just wonderful !!! The seafood penne was the best I've ever tasted! My sister ordered a parmegiana fillet with gouda cheese and my parents the famous cataplana with shrimp and lobster that were equally delicious! And to finish off petit gateau de doce de leite! Fair price for the high quality of the dishes! I highly recommend the visit.\n",
      "Very good food, with several options of pasta and seafood. The quick service caught my attention, and for those in large groups, it is worth the price.\n",
      "A buffet per kilo of salads, cold dishes, hot dishes and desserts with a lot of variety. It is a great opportunity to sample a little bit of regional cuisine. The food is very tasty and the space is beautiful.\n",
      "Happy Hour in style with double beer until 8 pm. Beautiful cover options with differentiated service.\n",
      "Okay, although I don't like lamb, I went to the restaurant several times, which offers all kinds of food. All, OK - but nothing exceptional. The service is good, the differential. Inside, the air conditioning is only switched on at 19/19: 30, as Fortaleza is hot, this is a huge disadvantage for those who go to hapy hour. Anyway, although it is good, for the price they charge you have many better options.\n",
      "The food is plentiful and good, with reasonable prices. It has a varied wine list, which are expensive.The biggest problem is the service, which is hampered by the huge size of the restaurant. According to the maître d ', the total capacity is for 570 people! Result: the food arrived for some and for others half an hour later, after several complaints.\n",
      "How great it is to return to Gulliver ...... It is one of JPA's best views. Certainly, it is the best restaurant in João Pessoa, among the best in the Northeast. Nice, elegant place, very well frequented. It has a professional, competent brigade, perfect service. The cuisine is magnificent, for a long time under the same command, dishes very well prepared, very well presented, rich in flavor, very well served. The wine list is perfect, with options for all budgets with fair prices. The presence of the owner maintains the excellent level for a long time, and in addition to all this, the wonderful view of João Pessoa's shore, FANTASTIC !!!. For all this, Gulliver is an exciting, lovely restaurant .........\n",
      "I loved the restaurant! Gourmet food in a relaxed and no-frills environment. Helpful staff. Dishes with interesting presentation. I arrived late and got a table fast. I believe that around 1 pm it is difficult to get a table without reservation.\n",
      "The atmosphere is welcoming, the owner goes to her table and tells her story, the waiter who served us was very friendly, but the moqueca with sea bass and prawns left a LOT to be desired ... The prawns were hard and the fish was dry. .. Due to the fame of the place, I believe we were on the wrong day, where things did not go very well.\n",
      "Extremely courteous service, with a fair price and excellent quality food, in large portions. The cub a dore, for starters, is a must. An informal conversation with the waiter - very easy to happen - reveals that some options are not on the menu, but are easily available, like the Moqueca de Pirarucu with shrimp, for example ... Dive in; any order will be very good!\n"

      "Restaurant by the pound, with plenty of variety and has a positive service differential. There are always options with meat, chicken and fish and for the prices in Copacabana this restaurant is very worthwhile.\n",
      "Excellent food, atmosphere characterized by the smallest details, typical live music, but the service sins in times of full house. Still, it is worth the experience!\n",

      "If you are the type who prefers a bar instead of a club, 1008 is the right place, well located, has excellent food, a pleasant atmosphere for a review with friends, or a celebration with the family.\n",
      "The beach bar called KANOA is very good.!It is located on the edge of maceio, being considered a mega beach shack that disputes space with Lopana. I went to both, and in both the environment is very nice, beautiful people, composed primarily of tourists, but well frequented by the natural of the land, with a great structure and excellent cuisine.We ordered a crab cone that was sensational!The service we were given was very good in Rafael's care - very good waiter, attentive and good at talking.

      "Carlos da Vila Madalena is a constant line, which disrupts the program. But their new unit, in Jardins (Rua Mello Alves corner with Alameda Tietê) is a hit in every way.The space is very beautiful, the service is attentive and committed, the eventual mishaps (the first time they forgot two pizzas, but they corrected in a very short time) are resolved with attitude, and the kitchen acts with taste - the pizzas have delicious pasta, the starters are delicious. great, and well made drinks. The Parma ham pizza with lemon zest is magnificent, and the tomato with alicce is a classic.Good location, beautiful and comfortable environment, and impeccable food. Everything you order from a pizzeria.\n",
      "Little famous hamburger but much better than the known ones! The flavor of the meat is different and wonderful! It has equally tasty milk shakes options.The only problem is that it is a small place and not so visible, it is inside a gas station on av chico ponte\n",
      "I went to the Itapuan restaurant, a branch in front of the sea, with a beautiful view of the beach. We ordered an octopus moqueca that was sensational, the octopus was in the right spot, juicy and soft that practically melted in your mouth; we also ordered a fish stew, it was also a great choice. Relatively high cost, but acceptable due to the quality of the food served. Portion well served, pleasant atmosphere and good service.\n",
      "There is no way not to go there and eat a delicious pastry, our traditional pastry always recommend to go there.\n",
      "It was my first trip to The W restaurant and I confess that I admired everything. Wonderful atmosphere, a beautiful view of the beach, there are very tasty drinks made by Allan Andrade, and to complete the service 100% the manager Antônio Fernando, always very attentive and kind, suggested a divine dish, the shrimp W. João Pessoa is to be congratulated for having a restaurant with excellent quality both in terms of taste and service. I'm sure to return to this restaurant. Super recommend\n",

      "They have one in Natal, well, but the city of João Pessoa is much better then Natal, in so many ways !! Mangai is a buffet restaurant with a wide selection to take the dish, fill it and weigh it and charge by weight. It's kind of a rustic casual atmosphere and many of the foods are actually quite good, but many are really Brazilian and cannot be enjoyed by othet Brazilian people then, but all in all one must do and a great experience too !!When you check out don't foget to get some bread that they sell at the control too !!\n",
      "Super nice place. Well air-conditioned, clean and organized. Varied menu with unusual options, such as Arabic Tuesday. Fair price.\n",
      "Great restaurant, top seafood. Congratulations to the whole team, especially to the very attentive and hotel waiter Eugênio.\n",

      "Good sandwich and ribs tbm, price a little high for the type of food but the food is good the service tbm! Worth knowing!\n",
      "At the German's bar it is worth visiting the submarine (draft beer with steinhaeger), the typical German dishes. I love jaguar meat (for unsuspecting tourists, it's just a nickname, the meat is beef. :))\n",
      "The restaurant has an interesting presentation, with very attractive combinations and dish options. The food is tasty and the price is affordable. As it is close to the sea, it was common to see people who had just left the beach go to lunch there.\n",

      "Trendy restaurant in Sampa, kilometer-long queue, reservation not available and trendy menu.We managed to get a table arriving an hour before the restaurant opened (noon)Great expectations, we ordered a tasting menu to get to know.Courteous but slow service, succinct presentation of the dishes, very nice-looking entrees however, tcham tcham tcham! Plenty of promise for little flavor, saving tatar and cracklings from starters, roast pork just right, cold and pururuca just reasonableAbusive price, unacceptable cost benefit.Opera summary: pretentious menu, extortionate price, São Paulo fashion showTry Minas Gerais and surroundingsEscape or pay the price, as I paid, of following gastronomic fad\n",
      "It remains one of the best Italians in Salvador. Cozy atmosphere, correct service and good wine list. The novelty is that now the famous fettuccini can come combined with some meat options.\n",
      "Very well organized, good food, cold beers! Good service, depending on the table you get. You have to arrive early, otherwise you won't have a table!\n",

      "Easy location. Ok atmosphere, nothing extraordinary, but ok.But when you look at the menu, it gives a little shiver, even though it doesn't have Italian origins. Picanha Pizza, file with fries, stroganoff, etc ...Can you really assess the quality of the pasta (texture, thickness, etc.), the tomato sauce (fresh, acidity, aroma) or even a restaurant that has it on the menu? We tried.Let's go to basicão, there will be no pepperoni error + muzarela.When the disc of what they call pizza arrived, what they call pasta was raw and on top it had filling for about 3 pizzas.Anyway, the best definition would be the following: ogre pizza.I won't be back, not recommended. But it has taste and taste for everything, right? Even for stroganoff pizza ...\n",
      "With great and wide ambience, followed by good food, with great variations of cuisines for all tastes, combined with good service, without a doubt Lá Parrilla is an excellent option to take the family.\n",
      "This restaurant is one of the best in barbecue. In addition, they have a huge variety of salads and side orders.\n",
      "Restaurant that excels in the roots and quality of Japanese cuisine. Master Jonny was always very friendly. The tip I put is to stay at the counter where you can analyze all the technique of sushi house and some news is always presented to you.\n",
      "Knowing this restaurant is almost a must for anyone visiting São Luis, great options at a fair price.\n",
      "I recommend the Picanharia dos Amigos, the imported picanha is sensational and Cristino's service is very good, friendly and polite. Whenever you come ask for Cristiano's assistance.\n",
      "Great! Nice and cozy place, varied menu with emphasis on pizzas, pasta and cocktails! good place for a drink and a chat, besides that the musical attractions are show of ball! Crispy and tasty pizza! I recommend!\n",
      "Nice place, cool, great location.Food with a fresh flavor and very well seasoned.Very good service.\n",
      "Great restaurant, with excellent dishes, to practice what I like most is the combination of sushi and sashimi, which comes in a very abundant boat, the waiters are very attentive and the atmosphere is very pleasant.\n",
      "From the rating here on Trip Advisor, I thought it would be much better. There was nothing too bad, but nothing surprised and some things disappointed! The menu is very extensive and we decided to look at the entrees. Nothing that touched us and we chose bruschetta with parma brie and arugula (that was delicious) and a house fillet, breaded with cheese filling (nothing much). A friend ordered a beef jerky crepe that according to him was good, another was parmigiana (the pasta that came with it was without any seasoning) and I ordered a fettuccine with shrimp, also with a super shy seasoning! At least by Brasilia standards it was super cheap! Overall experience ok but nothing to dazzle the eye!\n",
      "On the day that I was present, I ate only temaki and they are very well filled.Service was fast and the waiters were very attentive.\n",
      "Traditional restaurant in the south of Porto Alegre. Very frequented by the locals during the week. On weekends there may be a queue at certain times, but if you have the time and patience, it is well worth the wait.\n",

      "One of the best restaurants in Joao Pessoa. Super nice atmosphere, fair price, very good food. The staff are kind and welcoming. We were very well attended by Elton. Worth knowing.\n",
      "The crepes are tasty, welcoming atmosphere, with good service, interesting wine list, we always go.\n",
      "For those who like barbecue, but do not want to face a traditional carvery, Vitelo's is one of the best options in Belo Horizonte. Especially for the diaper, the flagship of the house and which lives up to fame. The ancho is also an excellent choice. Farofa is nothing spectacular, but it does its job. Pleasant, spacious, friendly service.\n",
      "Restaurant inside the Shopping Center Recife.Simple and pleasant environment. Excellent service. Diverse menu, from regional foods to sophisticated dishes like lobster / cod.Very affordable prices.\n",
      "My wife and I stayed at the Othon Palace Hotel and went on a Friday night. Tasty and abundant food, we eat a shrimp stew + acarajé + coconut water. Generous portion that would serve three people.Pleasant atmosphere, Bahians dressed in typical costumes.We spent R $ 180.00.\n",
      "For those who like to eat good cuisine: crustaceans, fish, salmon.The starter, a shrimp pie! Wonderful!\n",
      "Between variety, quality and price is the best buffet in town easy. There is always salmon or cod for example. I recommend.\n",
      "The place is very pleasant and refers to one of those old rural sales. The beer is cold but does not have many varieties. The dishes are well prepared, with special ingredients and very delicious. The portions are not large but they serve two people without much hunger. The prices ... these I found salty. I didn't have lunch, I stayed only at the entrances. The pork calf with potatoes at R $ 35.00, was very tasty with the meat falling apart and the boar sausage with 4 small pieces at R $ 28.00, also very tasty. Ah, just to clarify, the photo of the pork calf that appears on the site does not even remotely remember, in quantity of meat, the one that was served ...\n",
      "Comfort and tranquility on the flamengo beach. Tent with great structure, we were calm to leave our belongings and go to the sea. Very good snacks and reasonable price.\n",
      "Very tasty food, especially the skewers. The dish with bacon and chicken skewers accompanied by tropeiro beans, manioc, rice and vinaigrette is sensational!\n",
      "Located in a region full of bars, Piquiras stands out for its always cold draft beer. It is worth checking out not only Piquiras, but all the other bars in the region.\n",
      "Great food. Well-appointed space to wait for the call to enter the dining environment, not to mention the beautiful design in a rustic style. The food has no comments. Sensational\n",
      "I went for the second time, on a Sunday. On both occasions, I was very well attended. The house was very full and the waiter informed us that some dishes were taking a while to come out, but in the end they came at a normal time.Very cold beer, informal and typical northeastern atmosphere, which we really like. We sat outside initially because we wanted to be outdoors and when eating we asked for a table in the indoor area.Generous portions and very good food. We were in 8 people, on average for what we consume with drinks, desserts, snacks and dishes, we found the bill very fair.I will be back for sure, I recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "I was impressed with the service and treatment offered by the place. The entrance was magnificent. It's main dish was divine. Not to mention the petit gateau on the table. Reco, sticking with family and romantics too.\n",
      "The Potyguar restaurant offers good quality food, a clean environment, good service and excellent prices. Worth knowing!\n",
      "It is undoubtedly the best udon in São Paulo. And, perhaps, the best in Brazil - it even reminded me of some udon houses I visited in Tokyo or Kyoto. The only problem is that the menu is somewhat confusing, but nothing that the friendly service cannot explain. I left there satisfied and too happy. I thought it was so good that, in the three days I stayed in São Paulo, I had to go back there twice! A serious defect, however: there is only ONE vegetarian option, which is the udon with miso soup. It would be perfect if they included an extra option of vegetarian udon, with some vegetarian soup other than miso soup. Nothing against miso. But limiting vegetarian choices to just one dish is tricky with the kids.\n",
      "Much more than a bakery. Delicious pizzas, clean tables, variety of products, good service. Always busy. There is a breakfast buffet.\n",
      "I saw the reviews here on Trip and decided to have lunch there one day, so I ordered the pastrami sandwich; In my opinion it was a lot of slices and thick, which I don't particularly like, but ok is the sandwich style of the house. But the pastrami had a lot of fat, I ended up eating just a little bit because I didn't like the pastrami, but I ended up feeling sick afterwards.\n"

      "I visited Saatore during the Restaurant Week festival and rated it 10 for atmosphere, food and service. Spacious and modern environment. Friendly service. The festival's lunch dishes, veal and sole, were a spectacle.With the country's economic crisis, I believe that the movement fell and they had to change the cloth napkins for paper, but it didn't bother me.\n",
      "We were with the family in Barramares on a Sunday. The restaurant didn't get crowded at any time, but the occupation was quite considerable. The structure has improved a lot, considering that before it was almost a beach hut. Now, it is really a restaurant, with a nice menu and attractive prices, when it comes to the seaside. Currently with 2 swimming pools for children, the place has far surpassed the neighboring competitor. The service was good, with a little delay in change when we paid the bill, but nothing disappointing the rest of the experience in place. Congratulations to the owners for the leap in quality.\n",

      "Regional restaurant with decor very compatible with the proposal and great service, some buffet options were not so good (like cassava and chicken, a little hard) but the house specialties like pantim, coalho cheese rice and beef sun with cream, in addition to the desserts, were great. Worth knowing!\n",

      "Divina Gula has many attractions. Starting with style, with very detailed decoration, the restaurant even has a green area at the back.The food is very good. We tried the sample, which serves two people very well and brings several delicious dishes, such as crackling, pork ribs, chicken with okra, baião de dois, tropeiro beans, etc.Another advantage is that the restaurant has transfers to and from hotels.\n",
      "Excellent rest. Spacious, good service is a wide variety of food. One of the best Self-Service / Christmas carvery.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant with various types of salads and grills. Drinks for all tastes and compatible with restaurants of this size. Easy parkingGreat location.\n",
      "The canteen has a small space, very cozy, with few tables. A typical bistro. The menu has good options for pasta, entrees and desserts with varying prices, for all tastes and pockets. I went to Restaurante Week for a week and tried a maminha with polenta and funghi sauce. It was simply delicious! The sauce with good pieces of mushrooms, the tender and juicy meat and the polenta with a cheese crust was delicious. The dessert was a paçoca ice cream with a great chocolate sauce, which did not harden. Really good! I didn't think the dish was filling, just enough, perhaps because it was a Restaurant Week. Still, I would go back again and recommend going to the place.\n",
      "Tokio is a restaurant that, although it does not have the variety of a traditional Japanese restaurant, presents the innovation of contemporary restaurants without the eccentricity and ignorance that usually fall into that complete disharmony.At Tokio I had the opportunity to try dishes that dare, but have balance and are worth experimenting with. Under the supervision of Ana Rejane, manager and mother of the young owner, I was invited to taste something new that positively surprised me:Shake Sake Lemon, Flambéed shrimp folio, Sashimi Especial, Tokio Flambado and the unusual Pirulito were the dishes tried.Point to the first non-traditional restaurant that was really worth the experience. Congratulations to Tokio's sushi men. Congratulations to Ana Rejane for caring and attraction.\n",
      "Certainly one of the best kilo options in the region. I'm not a big fan of the category, but this one has variety and quality cuisine. Be sure to take the great meat croquettes and, if you have, the bean tutu.\n",

      "The environment is very simple, but the food pays off. Exceptional quality!\n",
      "The chorizo ​​steak is very good. The side dishes are plentiful. The shrimp dishes for 2 people are also very good and full. They can easily accommodate 3 people. The dulce de leche pancake dessert with ice cream is a delight. Nice place next to Santos Dumont airport.\n",
      "Restaurante Yemanjá is very traditional in Salvador. Faithful to Bahian cuisine, it has an entrance of small, very crunchy acarajés with a generous portion of vatapá and dried shrimp. The dishes are well served and the price is fair. OThe atmosphere is very themed and cozy, in addition to impeccable service. As a dessert I suggest the cocada but order the white and burnt mixture. It's delicious. It's worth the experience !!!\n",

      "I took some friends from São Paulo to eat at this restaurant, which I have known for some time.The food is wonderful and the value for money is very good! It is about 60 reais per person with service and a non-alcoholic drink. My dish was a pumpkin batter and gorgonzola sauce with nuts. A delight.Needless to say, the Paulistas loved it. Nothing so good is eaten for that price over there and the typical Brazilian and creative dishes like pasta stuffed with plantains accompanied by fresh fish are a guaranteed success\n",
      "I love this place!!! Always cold beer, varied snacks, tapioca, pizza, pastries, always delicious. It also has a children's playground for parents to rest assured while they stay in place.\n",
      "The service is excellent, super nice place and with an incredible view !!!Not to mention the wonderful food 🥰\n",
      "Steakhouse with variety of food, good meats, table for preparing pasta, sushi and plenty of cold cuts. I don't agree with the cover charge, because the piano is so low that you end up not listening! Relatively expensive drink and desserts.\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, the best are the dishes, sensational, sophisticated menu, indescribable flavor, it's worth it!Congratulations to Léo Paixao!\n",
      "Quick option, delicious burrito, suitable for quick meals and at great cost. Service note 10. It is located in the windmill in a food court very cool, loved it.\n",
      "The place is really cool!A house transformed into a restaurant, very well decorated and with a picturesque air, gives the impression that sooner or later the owners of the house will sit at the table to eat together with us.And the fish, well the fish is delicious. I tried the tambaqui without bones and was extremely satisfied.\n",
      "The food is great, the atmosphere is pleasant and the staff are very attentive and funny!And there is still an alligator on a spit !!\n",
      "Excellence in service, comfort and taste, best food in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. Model restaurant in all aspects. I am allergic to shrimp, yet it is my favorite restaurant, even the dishes without shrimp are excellent!\n",
      "delicious soup .... pleasant atmosphere .... unfortunately the service is terrible ... 95% of the waiters are thick ....\n"

      "Nice place, well frequented and with a well provided service. The service exceeded expectations and is a differential of the place. I would certainly go back and recommend it to my friends.\n",
      "Super friendly service from the waiters - I can't say the same about the hostess who served us at the entrance (it can get better).The view is incredible. The menu appeals to all tastes and the price is quite expensive, but not exorbitant (considering that the place is very different). I ate a moquequinha, well served for one person, for R $ 89.00. Brazilian foams are on average 89 to 150 reais a bottle. Very tasty homemade beers - worth a try. We paid 50 reais by taxi in flag 2, leaving Ipanema - the taxi driver was a little lost.Tip: if you go on weekends or holidays, book and ask for a table with a view!I recommend!\n",
      "Very good food at a super fair price. First-rate service. I highly recommend the visit in this place!\n",

      "A dear friend from Belgium, a lawyer from the European Union, stayed at a delightful inn in Santa Tereza and we arranged a dinner and chose Tereze as it was nearby and I wanted to meet myself. Well, I called to book and when we got there we chose a discreet table, taped to the wall. The waiter pulled us a light from the floor lamps that illuminate the dark environment. I must add that the restaurant is very dark from the floor to the walls. The view is read but it was night and our table was not close to it. We ordered a starter with ceviche and a basket of bread. This arrived only after the ceviche was finished and it was in a bowl and there were no dishes so the bread would help us transport it to the mouth. When she arrived, after several promises, came those ordinary breads from Rio, that is NOTHING expected from a French restaurant. In addition, breads in the cushion style, which can not even be called brioche and not toast or something harder, as it should be. At this point, I wouldn't even be able to complain ... Then the main course arrived and, unfortunately, another couple arrived at a table next to ours. The waiter immediately took the lamp from us and took it back to another table ... without even apologizing, making excuses for anything ... In order not to create a climate to spoil the night, I shut up and was ashamed of the faux pas ... The food was very normal for a restaurant so famous and very expensive and the service, much to be desired ... the bill was absurd considering that neither wine we drink nor dessert we ask: R $ 150.00 PER HEAD !!! My Holy Terezinha, Terese never again !!!!\n",
      "With very good service, this steakhouse offers options for all tastes.Here you can find meat, fish, pasta, Japanese food, salads, in short ...Everything with lots of flavor !!From the carvery I tasted the tastiest fish I could ever taste.From the area of ​​Japanese food, ceviche is wonderful, while making the most of the other dishes.Highly recommend !!Best cost benefit of the category.\n",

      "Cariri is the face of Sergipe that everyone should know. It represents the Sergipe culture through its music, folkloric manifestations, decoration, typical dishes, delicacies, as well as a dance hall where several couples dawn the day arising the buckle to the sound of forró, xaxado, baião, xote, ... and so on.If you come to Aracaju and don't go to Cariri, you don't have a complete memory of the city\n",
      "Well, it is one of the most famous restaurants for its very tasty pizzas. I just don't give 5 stars because it's always very crowded and the price is high when compared to other environments in Fortaleza\n",
      "Cozy place, wonderful view, good service and approved menu! I recommend.I liked it so much that we are going back to say goodbye. 🔝👏🏻😃👍🏻\n",

We took the Premium buffet, there are 3 types of buffets (soft (75.00): without temaki and without sashimi; normal (85.00): with 10 pieces of sashimi and temaki, Premium (95.00): all included). We left very satisfied, very good table service, huge variety on the buffet, few vegetarian options, our friend got a special vegetarian combo. I recommend. I hope to be back soon.\n",
      "Great menu, excellent service, don't delay, great indication to go out with friends! Great food\n",
      "Congratulations ! Cozy space, friendly and prompt servicegreat food! All very good!I didn't know Minas Gerais food well and I was surrendered ...To return (if I return to Belo Horizonte one day) but to recommend it to anyone from Portugal who comes here.Congratulations Dona Lucinha!\n",

      "I had never noticed a difference between one Habib 's and another. Same food, same decoration, everything always the same, but when I saw this unit I saw a difference. I always go because of the price, ease, but the service at this unit was special, attentive. It has wi fi and free parking, drive thrue. Liked it.\n",
      "It's a really nice place, good decor, good atmosphere, very good food at a fair price. Undoubtedly an option for those who do not want to go wrong on a trip.\n",
      "To end an excellent Carnival, we again insist on having dinner at Pereira on an Ash Wednesday. In the previous year, the experience had not been good - dishes changed and with missing ingredients, but we were betting that it had been a point out of the curve for having gone before and everything went well. But this last time they overcame it: the main dishes took an hour and forty minutes to be served !!! This is after we complain and threaten to leave. This without any explanation or apology from the staff of the house. Despite being a restaurant that I always go to when I go to Salvador, it is a warning not to risk ruining your night with a wrong choice.\n",
      "We went to the restaurant on a Sunday night and it was packed, leaving us with a feeling of having chosen the right place. Great service, delicious pizza, to the sound of piano! We love it and will be back!\n",
      "One of the best pizzerias in Alagoas. I attend since I was little and recommend it to friends always. The atmosphere is very cool, with several old photos of Maceió, a cool place, great to go with family and friends. The only thing that sins is the lack of ample parking.\n"

Well located, under trees that give it shade and a cooler atmosphere to the place, its menu is very varied, with dozens of sandwich options.

      "I've been to this place twice, but I regretted it both times. At first I went and didn't like it, I tried the second, but it remained the same. The waiters are poorly oriented, offer rotation, but are unable to meet the demand. Hots are cold and sushi comes with a lot more rice than salmon.\n",

The rodizio is a little different from what we are used to in RIO, it had pasta with white sauce, stroganoff, gnocchi ... but it also had rice, pastries and dumplings. All fresh, the waiters always on request, we really like it!\n",

The strong one there, in fact is the Chicken in brown sauce  of 10 orders, 9 are chicken in brown sauce, which is also accompanied by rice and cornmeal angú. I've never seen so many happy people with this dish. The restaurant is beautiful! .... It was a house and its floor is all in plank and has a balcony where they put tables, and it was super nice. The walls of the house have many photographs of important people who passed by or were regular customers like ex-president Jucelino, Carlos Drumont de Andrade, Milton Nascimento, etc.There are also many trees there, including a jabuticaba tree that brings shade and gives a very special charm. I love having lunch there. And you. for sure you will like it too.\n",
      "The restaurant is hosting the Seafood Festival. The facilities are simple (paper towel), but the atmosphere is pleasant and the service is very attentive and helpful. The buffet is reasonable, highlighting the paella which was tasty. Skewers with Mecca fish and Pistol Shrimp are served directly on the table. Worth it! The cost-benefit ratio is good.\n",
      "The restaurant is the only one located on the edge of the beach, at Farol da Barra. The food is very good and the prices and services are good. What sets this restaurant apart is the location and privileged view of the sea and Farol da Barra. You don't want to leave.\n",

This is the idea of ​​the establishment. If you want to eat fried chickens and have sauces for snacking, it is recommended.The restaurant is often on the website Pedida de Hoje. Worth the tip for those who want to save money.\n",
      "The pizzeria is very good. Ample space, fair price, small kids space but meets the needs. Attentive employees, pizza being offered at all times, a place with easy access.What I didn't like was the cheese on the pizza. After the seventh piece his was already sick. The cheese tasted just like gorgonzola cheese. I don't know why but I think they should use the mozzarella. I arrived very hungry and the strong flavor of the cheese used in the pizzas (which was certainly not mozzarella) took away all my desire to eat. In the most, I recommend.\n",

      "Italian cuisine, very popular in Brazil, does not count, at least in Rio de Janeiro, with top representatives, at least in the quantity that the city deserves.Here comes a new option, and not just any one, but very good, surprising even, in the case of a small neighborhood restaurant in Copacabana, with few places and a choice of dishes.However, at least when I was there for the first time, and that happened last Friday, everything I tried was at least very good, if not excellent.Considering the small space, even wines can be of good and excellent quality, even with the usual salty prices.Good well-crafted ingredients, resulting in tasty dishes.I also had fun with the service, with a deliciously bad-tempered waiter, which for me, at least, is an eye candy in the face of general subservience that even many demand from the profession, forgetting that people are different, have good and bad days, you have the right to be what you are and not just wear the appropriate masks for each profession and occasion. This yes sir no sir thing is for militants: better is the singular expression of those who work but do not leave their personality aside.I only regret that the space does not open for lunch.\n",

      "Good standard hamburger. Modern architecture and themed snacks. A touch of sophistication in the dishes. In my opinion the hamburger should be more original. It is made with good quality meat, but it escapes the American flavor, lacking a touch of barbecue. Prices are fair and service is reasonable. The weaknesses are: difficulty in parking, a noisy room due to lack of acoustic treatment and the worst. Do not issue tax coupon if not required.\n",

The shrimp dumpling with catupiry is no longer the same, as are the others, salty snacks. We had to return the baked pastry that was raw. The ham portion, however, was good. The waiter was very attentive. It is fair to point out that the draft beerremains great. One of the best in Rio. In addition, disappointment\n",

      "For more than twenty years serving Chinese food on a whim and honest.Salads well prepared, fresh and delicious.Hot dishes indicate the fish with spicy sauce that has no pepper. The whole pasta with vegetables and also the fried fish.on weekends there is shrimp in sauce.I recommend. Support staff very attentive.\n",

      "we ate some delicious meat accompanied by chimichurri and a spectacular wine, I recommend it to everyone, a must see !!\n",
      "Many very expensive beers.I usually try different beers on my travels and at home too. Without a doubt, this was the place with the most expensive labels I have ever encountered. Result: you get discouraged and don't try everything you would like.The values ​​are so unrealistic that a very ordinary Uruguayan beer, sold in markets, is charged with the value of 3 times that practiced anywhere else.There is nothing on site to justify the prices. Next to it you will find better bars and prices to match.A feather.\n",
      "The savory ones are delicious, but the party ones are rubbery the next day.I bought the brigadeiros for a party yesterday, the 26th, they cost $ 0.65 a unit and the disappointment was general: they are made from that chocolate mass like ALISPEC. Horrible!And for the price it should be condensed milk.I do not recommend.\n",
      "Super nice place For couples and family, just sin the amount of street vendors that unfortunately is not their fault.\n",
      "Good food with an interesting variety of seafood, but be careful, as the place has a religious decoration that may not please everyone.\n",
      "No words to describe the best Arabian food from the countryside! Wonderful service, from arrival to departure, the owner and chef Paco is mega attentive! We tried the trio of pastas, the meat sfiha with three cheeses and the famous Saint Marie kibe. I can't choose the best ... definitely a place that deserves to be known, prices that fit all budgets, generous portions and unparalleled flavor! I say and repeat: Paco, my stomach is hopelessly in love with your food! I can't wait for our next meeting!\n",
      "It has trailers for all tastes. And the price is average compared to the city's food trucks ...I recommend the 162, wonderful and right at the entrance!I tasted a sandwich called Pancepis, but I don't remember the name of the truck ... very good too and with a wonderful potato chip.But there is everything: Peruvian food, crepe, hot dogs, kebabs!If you are in Augusta between, it is very worth it!\n",
      "This Vezpa de Laranjeiras is very well located, in a central position of the neighborhood. The place is pleasant and the service was quick and attentive. I will come back more often.\n",

      "I had many disappointments with restaurants on this return to the northeast this summer, but Mangai does not disappoint! Everything was perfect, as always. Even the waiting line (unheard of for me) was extremely well organized. We really like the varieties and the environment.\n",
      "The place has nothing dirty ... on the contrary, well tidy, chilled environment, very good service and the delicious Fred Flinstone steak (huge) !!! Worth it!!!\n",
      "The atmosphere is the restaurant's strong point. The food is very good, maybe something is missing. The portions (as in every French restaurant) leave a little to be desired. Highlight for the cucumber mousse at the entrance, it is very interesting.\n",
      "I was at the restaurant at Shopping Higienópolis, the atmosphere is pleasant but the service left something to be desired. What about the dishes then? Very small, the price is not high but for the quantity that comes it ends up getting expensive! We ordered starter (completely individual), main course (which looked like an appetizer) and dessert and we still left hungry! The quality of the food was good, but nothing exceptional.\n",
      "The restaurant is wonderful. Great service, calm atmosphere, wonderful food ... On Valentine's Day they always make a different decoration.\n",
      "For me, one of the best lamens I've ever eaten in my life, outside of Japan. There's always a queue, but it's worth it, because the lamens and dumplings are delicious!\n",
      "Na Praça is located in Praça de Casa Forte, with easy parking. It offers two well decorated rooms, an external balcony and an internal area. Opens for lunch time with executive dishes well served and affordable prices. On Thursdays there is a beer clone and some snacks from the menu with live music.\n",

      "I love this restaurant, we have the option to eat outside, very tasty. Something I love there are the seafood, special attention to ceviches and paellas are magnificent. It is very worth knowing. Due to the location and the quality of the service, it is not very expensive. There is a deserted street next to it to leave the car.\n",
      "Very cool atmosphere, super friendly and helpful staff. Varied and well prepared menu. Quality and delicious food. Chef Marcio is to be congratulated! We went a few times and ate very well! Super recommend !!\n",
      "At lunch and dinner there are two alternatives: free buffet and carvery, with prices according to the market.The space between tables is practically non-existent and the waiters and customers are constantly bumping into the tables.The service is slow and even though Brahma's draft beer is available, you will suffer a lot in replacement.WiFi is reasonable.There is no toilet but only toilet.As the beers are only long neck, I also do not recommend opting for them, as the replacement will take a long time.The salad buffet is simple, as are the hot dishes and the desserts.The meats are hard and do not match a good barbecue, except the beef rib.The rotation is very slow and the first cut steak appears rarely.The amount of the rotation including the 10% is R $ 57.00.The cost x benefit is reasonable.\n",
      "Nice place, the rock atmosphere of the place is great, I just think the menu could be more varied. At the top of the pub it is a little dark which makes it difficult to see the menu, they could improve the ambient light\n",
      "I was with friends and the place pleased everyone! Great service, an incredible menu, is a very differentiated environment. I recommend the fillet of sea bass and the hidden meat. A beautiful presentation.\n",
      "For those who call themselves the king of cod, they serve a horrible pastry that doesn't taste like cod. The shrimp is less bad but I've eaten much better on the street. Disappointment, fried with old oil and little filling.\n",
      "Excellent cost benefit. A place of easy access, excellent for parking and very cozy. Plenty of cold cuts and sensational meat carvery. All to the sound of live piano. I recommend.\n",
      "My assessment is about lunch during the week. On Wednesday there is a very well served feijoada, which can be shared. On the other days it is possible to choose some meat, fish, chicken, etc. and serve yourself at the salad buffet, which is also part of the feijoada. The buffet is simple.The cuisine and service are not enough to stand out, but it is a good option for lunch, with a good cost / benefit ratio.\n",
      "For those who enjoy a great barbecue, accompanied by a delicious mayonnaise, as well as a range of vegetables, I recommend this restaurant, apart from that the reception is very good, comfortable and cozy.\n",
      "One of the executive dish options at Tradicional Grill, in Barra. Beautiful and delicious food. Quiet surroundings and incredible views. Congratulations!\n",
      "I really liked the restaurant. Attentive waiters, good price, very good server dishes. One plate is enough for 2 people. Varied menu. Family atmosphere. Agreement with parking at the side (I found the parking a bit expensive).\n",
      "It's the best frozen I've ever tried. The creaminess and flavor are perfect ... tastier than ice cream. I don't pass by Liba without a cup!\n",
      "Better than soooo many in São Paulo! Soft meat, on the spot. Top quality bread. Light and tasty. Oh, and the service is undoubtedly the best in town!\n",
      "I really enjoyed the service and the atmosphere, not to mention the first quality meats, but I confess that I found it strange that there was no self service buffet.\n",
      "Great service. Friendly and attentive waiters. Dishes served super fast, and divine !!!! I didn't see any defects.Be sure to eat shrimp in Natal!\n",
      "Another star to brighten up the São Paulo night. Cozy atmosphere with few tables, some occupy the balcony and the friendly service set the tone for the place that occupies a house in the middle of Oscar Freire in Jardins. But the highlight is the quality of the culinary proposal inspired by the Spanish Mediterranean with a strong Catalan accent. I had the privilege of visiting the family restaurant, Can Bosch, which is in Cambrils, near Barcelona, ​​owner of a deserved Michelin star. And, without risk of exaggeration, I can assure you that Tanit maintains the high standard of the original house. The beginning couldn't have been better: pintxos de pulpo, pan with tomatoes and jamón and tuna tartar. Then, to our delight, we were able to enjoy delicious black rice, grilled octopus and filet of angus in the reduction of Porto. And, without fear of being happy, we concluded the banquet of the gods with two of the wonders of the dessert suggestions, the caramelized banana and the coulant. And long live São Paulo !!!\n",
      "Restaurant of a Great Chef of haute cuisine. Simple atmosphere (a house), top-notch food, fantastic menu and fair prices. Highly recommended for those who enjoy good food.\n",
      "Located in a very nice neighborhood, beautiful, cozy house, first class meat. Very well attended by Daniel. Fair price.\n",

      "The decoration of the store is very well assembled and has many types of pasta and imported products. A small and charming lounge guarantees quick meals at any time.\n",
      "Bad experience.I'm staying at a hotel near the hamburger shop, I placed my order and the courier couldn't find it. I called to find out what was going on and left me on the line waiting for more than 15 min. I tried to call several times and the phone was just busy. It probably got off the hook.I called again and the attendant Amanda, the same one to whom I placed the order, finally got her the phone and said that the biker was making another delivery. 1.30h after placing my order.\n",
      "Cozy restaurant, good service, delicious food, several options.I had a parmesan risotto with funghi fillet, very good.\n",
      "The reception, the atmosphere, the quality, the fantastic service.In addition to all the happy hour and a separate attraction, in addition to the quality and differentiated price for alcoholic beverages, they also have a refill of chips and refrigerant.Undoubtedly worth the visit.\n",
      "I really like this bar / restaurant. The shrimp bobó is excellent, despite the fact that there is an insignificant portion of rice. The tranquility and the view are in themselves a great request. The soundtrack with Brazilian popular songs in a perfect volume, in a low volume, to allow people to talk in peace, is VERY well arranged. When there is a band or a singer it is not so pleasant, because the volume is very high, but when it is only ambient music it is very good.\n",

      "Beach tent with comfort and fine restaurant service. The breaded shrimp with provolone is sensational (I miss it !!). Pleasant atmosphere, well frequented, beautiful decor and a very varied menu. It even has a wine cellar. All of this on a deck on the beach sand. Unmissable!\n",
      "Good place to eat a quick barbecue, with a good price, cold beer, several options on the menu, but ask for the service, very slow waiters.\n",
      "Great. We followed the tip of the blog Destemperados and went there. We ordered semolina gnocchi without words! My boyfriend ordered Rigatoni in the oven stuffed with buffalo mozzarella and cream of funghi porcini gratin and spek ... and mine ... I confess I don't remember the name of the dish ... but it was sensational. The dessert ... chocolate pie with red syrup ... ask! It's really worth it. End of melody..R $ 226 with 1 glass of wine and refreshments. More than worth it!\n"

There were three of us and the dish we chose was served on a refractory tile dish and the taste was just fantastic! The portion was generous and was enough for three people.

      "as I said in the last evaluation I did a long time ago, I go to the Zen Japanese food restaurant monthly, always in the bramble, but since opening the patteo shopping center in olinda, i have been to this one ... but last saturday i went to olinda and it was a disappointment ... disoriented waiters, erring the order of the dishes, both in the quantity ordered and in the options chosen ... a horror ... other than that, the dishes that came right, like the skewer of cubes of chicken in shoyo sauce and honey, small pieces came much smaller than normal and the chicken, almost raw ... oo salty yakisoba which is not usual ... the mini shrimp tepan, which brings rice vegetables, potatoes, mix of vegetables, brought only 5 tiny shrimps (THAT TYPE BAKE FOR FISH) ... differently from other times, which was little but not so little ... a dish like this cannot bring so much carbohydrate and vegetables and only bring this protein ... in short, we found that this time zen reduced the amount to the maxino and proteins in their hot dishes, which are our forte, since we don’t eat from the raw part ... but a reason to serve us well since we don’t ask for susihis and sashimis that have more proteins. finally, I hope it was a lapse of a single time and that it will not be repeated. we were so disappointed that we’re going to take a break, and unlike the frequency of monthly outings, we’re only going to be in a few months now, because we’re really heartbroken ... we hope that next time we go it willn’t happen, because if it happens again, it will be. unfortunately cut out of our restaurants that we usually go to, which is a shame and we will regret it a lot because we like zen we have good memories, but we will not accept such a drop in service ... the record is, thank you.\n"

While waiting for my change, the employee (or owner, I don't know) looked at me and asked what I expected. I said the change was missing. She showed me the invoice, which she charged for THE SERVICE. From a drumstick I ordered for the trip. Brazilian law DOES NOT OBLIGATE the consumer to pay for the service. Did I ask (politely) service? what service? In which she explained  oh, there's the cost packaging! '. I don't know, but I never saw any bakery, Mcdonalds charging for the paper that wraps the snack ... She then said she was being nice, because with the service or packaging it would cost 50 cents more, which she was not charging me (in this case, stealing my money).Finally, I, who am celiac, like in several gluten-free bakeries whenever I can. I can say that this was the worst vegetarian drumstick I've ever eaten. The dough was dry, hard, and the filling poorly seasoned, a type of mushroom that did not match the coxinha. It broke into pieces in my hand, the dough was heavy, thick and not at all smooth. I have no interest in returning to the place and I recommend that you go far if you are looking for good service or quality food. The lack of respect for the customer is unbelievable.\n",

The restaurant is not on the edge of Atalaia, it is on a street behind, near the Passarela do Caranguejo, as the hotel I was staying in was about 20 min walk and I did not want to walk, promptly they arranged a taxi for me. I loved the food and service, despite being expensive, it is worth going.\n"

      "The Italian brothers are very pleasant and attentive. The pizza is very thin crust. The calzone is very good and the lazanha is sensational. All with a taste of genuinely Italian pasta.\n",
      "Pizzeria well located, two air-conditioned environments, pizzas of various sweet and savory flavors, thin and very tasty pasta, fair price. I recommend.\n",
      "It was recommended by a friend from the city. It is simple, colorful, the waiters are also old and the menu is classic and well served. I ate pork chop and a friend the cod. At the other tables, little white heads discussed the future and at another one a lady was reciting. If you are in the center, it is worth having lunch there.\n",
      "It is the legitimate American style in Brazil, both for service and food. Very well prepared and very tasty, but expensive. Arrive early on Sunday or you'll wait a long time\n",
      "I was unable to enter such rudeness and lack of education from the attendant outside. Poor service, but thanks to her I met a much better restaurant, thank you!\n",
      "Perfect, great structure, good service, wonderful beach. More than recommended. We do not order any dish, we stay in ice cream and drinks, but the prices on the menu are within those found in other restaurants on the waterfront.\n",
      "It offers a wide variety of typical foods from our city, especially with regard to seafood. Good location, good service and easy access.\n",
      "The only good points are that the place is beautiful and the food is good. However, the service is very slow, several times we need to ask the security to call someone to assist us, since the house was not even full. In addition, we were only informed about the cover charge for DJ at the cash register, since the entry only contained the amount for the band. Anyway, it left a lot to be desired, I do not recommend it.\n",
      "Call cute, stripped. I went to dinner. First and great pizza snacks with long fermentation dough. Very attentive service.\n",
      "Rich menu with generous portions, do not hesitate to order half a portion even if accompanied.I stayed by the window on the top floor, it was worth it.When I am in the region again I intend to return, great cost benefit.\n",

      "I went to this restaurant with great expectation after reading good recommendations, the price was good, but the meal was not one of the best I had in Natal and the waiter when asked about the dish seemed to be unaware of it. A restaurant that I would not return to in Natal unfortunately.\n",
      "Imagine an excellent service, from waiting with some tastings and the possibility of ordering drinks, in addition to waiting in a super cool sitting space. After entering I suggest the special rotation, but this special is SPECIAL, I have already evaluated dozens of japa, but this one surpassed my favorite Ayoama. It lives up to the fame and the evaluations, simply a must for those who like Japanese food, everything of great quality and an excellent cost benefit. I recommend and I will return !!! A +++++\n",
      "Traditionally, everything well done, very attentive staff, especially the meter Carlos, knows everything..rsrsrs, Like every Friday in São Paulo, the good restaurants are packed with waiting lines, but it's worth it.\n",
      "Galpão Crioulo is the main steakhouse in Porto Alegre. With a typical gaucho barbecue, local dance shows and exemplary service, it is a great place to take tourists. Tourist spot in the city.\n",

      "great option to drink and eat, quiet place to go with your family, sea view and inside there are pools for you to enjoy the environment.\n",
      "I went on the Thursday of the Corpus Christ holiday around 9 pm. we waited about 40 min to be seated at the table. When we finally sat down, no waiter came to place our orders, we waited about 20 minutes even calling to come and serve us. When we finally made it, our order took another 15 to arrive at our table. Outside we saw the waiters looking for which table the order was from. when it arrived i saw that my milkshake was wrong, because no oreo came. They fixed it by placing the oreo is more strawberry which made it too strong. We saw them looking for the table again when they came with the snacks and we signaled that it was ours. Regarding the snack it was ok. My bill was 35.90 because I ordered the milkshake kids which is enough after this snack. Of course, we don't pay for the service.\n",
      "The restaurant has a super cool atmosphere, is frequented by young people, and the service is also friendly and efficient. In my opinion it is a program that has no mistake for small groups or young couples.The food is very good, a relatively lean menu, but with enough options to please all palates.I think one of the highlights is the drinks, the wait at the bar is super pleasant, the bartenders prepare great options. I recommend the visit.\n",
      "After ordering in several of the neighborhood I decided that this is the best pizza in the region.Good price and the taste is excellent. I became a loyal customer.\n",
      "We ordered a Canto do Mangue Executivo Shrimp for 2 people. Very well served, sensational flavor!The service was also great, from the reception to the waiter Rodrigo.I definitely recommend it and will be back to try other dishes.\n",
      "I went out to lunch on Sunday at a restaurant in Botafogo, I called to book and confirm, but when I arrived I had an electrical problem and I went ahead and when I passed by the lions square I remembered Policarpo, who ended his activity a few months ago and just ahead DOS SANTOS excellent pleasant and well decorated environment (except the height of the wall bench in relation to the height of the table)quick and attentive servicevaried menu for all affordable diet linesI'll be back\n",
      "Very good restaurant, in the afternoon has a buffet, for those who do not know it is nice to try a little of each thing. Ambience is not very big, but it is very cozy. I recommend!\n",
      "In Rio Grande do Sul the descendants of Italians (here called Gringos) have the leadership of steakhouses. However, to confirm that every rule has an exception, there is Churrascaria Schneider run by descendants of Germans. Follows the model of those that serve the meat on the tables by rotation system. Salads and some entrees at a central table, buffet style, where some hot dishes are also found. The difference is on account of another buffet with delicious hot seafood dishes. It is impossible to taste everything, there are so many varieties and in the end, to finish off with any appetite, another counter, now with handmade desserts. Good wine list, very cold beers, soft drinks, juices and an espresso to finish off. It has its own parking with security. High price, but proportional to quality.\n",
      "I paid a visit just to have an evening snack.I tried a portion of pastel.The atmosphere is very pleasant, reasonable price within the average of the region.\n",
      "I didn't like it, but it's not bad or horrible.They serve as a starter for salads, chips and pasta, basically garlic and oil spaghetti and spaghetti in butter. The ceaser salad is kind of a rereading of them, with sun-dried tomatoes and no croutons ... The potatoes are good and the garlic and oil spaghetti too. You can ask me what this has to do with fondue I answer: I have no idea ...About the fondues ... They put funghi in the cheese fondue, I didn't like the strong flavor that was left. The meats were good, but, as someone else commented here, all the sauces are practically the base of mayonnaise, I didn't like it either. I ended up opting for the pasta to accompany (I looked at its usefulness). The chocolate one is good, but I don't think it's worth the visit just because of it.The environment really needs a better exhaust of air, there is a lot of smoke and you leave with the smell of food from head to toe.The service was good.\n"

      "Good for seafood, they have nothing for anyone, be sure to taste the moquecas only Yemanjá does with quality control.\n",
      "I do not recommend. Bad food, bad service. Bad. Pricey for the type of food. Not worth it. Ugly and stuffy place.\n",
      "The atmosphere in the outdoor area and on the lower floor is very nice, on the upper floor where we were allocated, despite the very well arranged tables, there is an air of deposit full of stacked wine boxes and some exposed bottles. But okay, I believe it was supposed to look cool / relaxed. The service was average, the waiters tried hard to be quick but they didn't even wait for everyone to finish ordering and they were gone. We were a group of five adults and a child. Only after 30 minutes of the order I was informed that I would have to choose another dish because the mandioquinha gnocchi was not available. The other orders came after we complained about the delay. My dish came without one of the side dishes and when I asked for it, they brought me a replacement as the side described on the menu was also not available. All the dishes were tasty but due to the experience as a whole it was not enough to wish to return to the establishment.\n",
      "The service is good and is located in the Ponta Negra region. The dishes are well served and serve even more people than indicated on the menu. The food is good, but not surprising. Although the dish was shrimp, there were very few shrimp.\n",
      "Good food! They serve a delicious bread with herbs in olive oil, as well as a bottle of water. The waiters are attentive and friendly. In the bathroom there is an audio teaching Italian. So much fun! Pleasant environment!\n",
      "Very nice place, excellent wine list, with great options of grape type and prices. The service can and should improve. Prime location and top public. There has to be a more adequate service for this audience. I had the misfortune of the starter and the main course being salty. But I was taken care of and they changed the dishes. Worth knowing.\n",
      "Good music, interesting decor, excellent service and good pizza !! Price not very affordable, but worth the cost benefit !!!\n",
      "Restaurant with excellent food, good service, placeNice thing that I found interesting was the European style service, it serves free water\n",
      "Gnochi a la salsa with DIVINE shrimp! An excellent choice for those who appreciate this type of pasta. Juicy and well served dish, in an intimate and charming environment.\n",
      "Great option for those in hotels in San Francisco and the Renaissance. Recommended for those who like celada beer.\n",
      "Lousy service !! The Lamb with a lot of fabric softener !! A disappointment !! It needs to improve a lot! Bad sheep ...\n",
      "Restaurant with plenty of variety, fresh, constant replacement of dishes.Special attention to the typical Brazilian dishes, which are wonderful.Clean and pleasant environment.\n",
      "Excellent space for a business meeting or just a good place to have quality coffee. Highlight for the lunch options, accompanied by a coffee then of course, kkkk.\n",
      "Good vegan options on the menu could also include a pizza with nothing of animal origin. Loving service even when there was an error in understanding the order.\n",
      "A quiet and pleasant place, with a good price, service, very tasty pizza, worth it, I recommend.\n",
      "Hot, delicious, diverse food, good service, fair price. Good seasoning, cold drinks!\n",
      "I had heard very well and went to check it out !!! In fact the restaurant is rated 10 !!! Very attentive waiters, pleasant atmosphere and wonderful food !!!!! We like it too much. The starters are so good that it makes you want to be alone. But the dishes (although there are few options) and the desserts are divine too. It was just annoying the people waiting for the table to be propped up on our table and looking at us with the face of I can finish soon so I can sit. The restaurant is small and has a long queue ... I went to lunch on Sunday without reservation, I arrived at 12:30 and got one of the last tables available .....\n",
      "The antediment is very good, pleasant place, attractive price and delicious kibbeh. I went and really liked the place.\n",
      "Lines, lines, lines at the door. Place with few tables, crowded. Very good service, attentive, cuts, without excessive bow. Original food. Good price for what you offer. Chef present. What more can you ask for? And we were lucky enough to have very nice table neighbors.\n",
      "I made the mistake of ordering a snack from this establishment. In addition to all four orders being wrong, when I called the attendant I didn't want to change the orders, but the next time I would give me a discount on the purchase, absurd when comparing the value of four snacks with the discount of one. Upon passing it to the manager, she said she could send the correct orders, but that I would have to pay for the delivery !! After much discussion she revealed the problem: the money would come out of the payment of the employees responsible for the error: both the tele delivery and the new snacks, that's why so much inconvenience to reorder. In other words, establishment with poor customer service, order preparation, and still wanting their mistake to come out of my pocket. Enough reasons to never go back there or recommend it to anyone!\n",
      "I'll be straightforward: the restaurant is simple, so is the atmosphere, the service is good, the price is acceptable but the food ... this is wonderful! I always liked fish and on several trips to work I always value the quality of the food. Here at Canto da Peixada I found an excellent place to sample the very tasty fish from the rivers of the Amazon, always VERY well prepared. The staff are welcoming and made me feel comfortable taking a picture of one of the restaurant's frozen Tambaquis (see photo). The simple but pleasant place. I recommend it to anyone coming to Manaus for work or tourism.\n",
      "Without a doubt the best pies and sweets in town the price is a little bit salty but worth every penny really good!\n",
      "I had heard about Victrola several times. I know some people who are passionate about vinyl and play there. The day I decided to go, I ended up being surprised. In sound, The Doors, Dire Straits, Pink Floyd and many other incredible songs. The service was wonderful from start to finish, and finding a place like this, with good service, is almost like finding a treasure in Brasilia. Helpful, funny, kind. Victrola's waiters rock too much!The place is not very big. As I was with a group where people kept coming, we accepted the option of placing tables at the entrance, more specifically on the sidewalk. I loved it! It means: we don't want you to leave or be uncomfortable, we will manage! And the waiter went down and went upstairs all night to serve us in the greatest sympathy.Am I going back? Whenever you can!In my opinion the food is a little expensive. But the drink is in the average of Brasília, with beer at R $ 7 or R $ 8. Tequila (Cuervo) was at a wonderful price (at Brasilia level): R $ 10 in a generous dose.The bill was salty at the end, but it was so worth it that I could have stayed and spent more. This is what happens when we are well served. note: Clean bathroom and decoration are also important items! Everything was fine. I just imagined that such a cool place should inspire the people of Brasília more when it comes to opening up, being friendly, making new friends and so on.\n",
      "I went to have lunch with the family during the week and the place really pleased! The food is first class - we eat fish - and the service was good. There was a boring cat that rubbed on my wife's legs and some insects, but it was possible to get around! I believe the night is more eventful.\n",
      "It can be said that this restaurant is already part of the city's tourist spot. Chef Felipe has an incredible talent for regional cuisine. Whenever I receive visitors from outside, it takes to taste a starter of cassava foam with an ant to the most tasty tambaqui rib. One of the things that is worthwhile for tourists and asking to take a picture with the cover here is huge that they have frozen.They do not have their own parking lot, but on the street there is always a parking space. The environment is all air conditioned and is very spacious, but if you are having dinner with many people it is worth making a reservation.\n"

      "My family and I went to dinner at Aka Momiji, which we used to go to since Momiji, and we left disappointed.The restaurant works with two types of carvery, as shown in the photo on the menu below, Sushi Festival and Chef with different values ​​for lunch, dinner, holidays and weekends, in addition to a la carte dishes.Our parents opted for a la carte dishes, while my sister and sister-in-law chose the sushi festival, my brother who does not eat raw fish decided the Chef's, as I did, for having shrimp tempura and chicken katsu.The waitress informed that the 4 of us had to choose from a single festival, because there were differences in dishes, such as octopus sushi, shrimp and roe, and shrimp tempura, but we talked and she granted our order.The service from the waiters and pies was good, except for the delay in some dishes, the tuna, salmon and roe were tasty, like the tempura and shimeji, but the octopus was watery due to the mollusk freezing.We finished dinner and ordered the desserts that were included as described in the menu, but we were surprised by the information that only the Chef's Festival was entitled to. And the waiter commented that the Sushi Festival was on sale and that the shrimp tempura was included, since the menu is not on the menu and the waitress who served us did not inform us. In addition, he brought us the promotion brochure containing a photo with octopus sushi, which is not included!We were harmed by the misleading advertising on the menu, “buying a product” that does not offer what was advertised.The waiter said that the dessert we chose came only 1 unit and sent two to minimize what happened, however it was not an attitude to revert our dissatisfaction and mistakes made by the establishment.\n",
      "Dynamic and courteous service. Plentiful and tasty dishes. Drinks well presented. Excellent location and offer fair value parking. All the restaurants in this COCO BAMBOO group are TOP !!!\n",

We decided to leave and go to another place, they charged us the carvery in full, even though we saw that we didn't consume anything, nor did the drinks reach the table.

      "Delicious atmosphere, cold beer, beautiful and cool people, good service, pleasantly decorated environment, delicious food, a little expensive, price of tourist spot in the city of the season, but it is a great experience. Whenever I go to Santa Tereza, I have a cold beer at Bar do Mineiro.\n",
      "The restaurant is fantastic. Olives are, in fact, the best in the world. The risotto with truffle is wonderful, very tasty and ideal to accompany the lamb chops if you are in the mood to share the dishes to try more options. It is very worthwhile to go there for lunch or dinner.\n",
      "Bad service, everything I ordered took time. Cold draft beer and correct caipirinha. Bland fried shrimp. Lobster appetizer rubber is served with raw peppers without even sauté and capers ultra salted. A disappointment !!!\n",
      "Great quality food and well done. Good natural juices included in the buffet value. Recommend detox juice\n",
      "The food in this restaurant is just excellent. From the salad to the meats, everything is very tasty, in addition to the dishes coming in an amount sufficient for those who are hungry. Great location, close to the beach. The place is not so big, but it can receive a good number of people. There are tables inside and outside. One of the negative points I noticed were the flies that keep bothering even inside the restaurant. After lunch, don't forget to try the famous rapadura ice cream.\n",
      "Impeccable service, everything delicious, from the entrance to the dessert. Very cozy, although a little cramped. Divine cod and an excellent wine list.\n",
      "Varied self service with sushi, fish, seafood, ... Everything delicious and at a fair price. For families with small children, there is a very nice playground.\n",

      "Great pub, atmosphere exudes culture and good music. Very good food and drinks, with prices not too high. Worth it!!\n",
      "I recently went to D'leve and tried a new lunch menu! Healthy and tasty, just like everything that is made there! I love the wraps and the crepes. The price is not that affordable, but it is worth it if you want to eat something different without going off your diet.\n",
      "Very good menu. Excellent fish dishes ordered. Very good sun meat too. Nice place decoration. Good service ... Cozumel very tasty. Worth knowing.\n",
      "On the night of the final of the Copa America, we chose ground fire to celebrate a unique moment.After 2 hours of waiting due to the great movement of the restaurant (no criticism waiting, which was alerted) we were called to the table.While waiting, we ordered some very bad appetizers, fries, cassava and polenta.At the table, few meat options were offered. Diaper and maminha passed 4x each across the table. Lamb and picanha 1x, sausage and 1 or 2 types of meat passed.In the end, 150 reais per person in rotation.A total and great disappointment for the name and concept of the steakhouse.After calling the manager and showing indignation at the situation, the most that was offered was a courtesy rodizio for the next day, that we would no longer be in the city.In the end, no solution on the part of the manager, dine, which was worth a maximum of 40 reais per person, cost more than 150, and instead of ending the night with a flourish, we ended p .... of life by spending a lot of money and a lot of time in a crappy steakhouse.\n"

      "Le Bife (by chef Erick Jacquin) from SP and CT Boucherie (by chef Claude Troisgros) work with the same type of menu, you select a cut of meat and the accompaniments pass through the carvery system.I will not make a comparison here but I have already made an evaluation of CT Boucherie too.Both the cuts we tried and the side dishes were prepared almost to perfection, very tasty and even surprising when you are faced with the simplicity of a simple puree but it was very well done.Friendly service and consistent with the gastronomy proposal, but in the case of São Paulo, cordial service is not at all difficult to find.\n",

Compared to other parts of the world where there is Subway here in Belo Horizonte, your meal does not cost less than R $ 15.00, not including the drink. But I think that sometimes we can give ourselves this pleasure. Thinking of the long lines that we now find, the restaurant has many options for healthy food. Employees who sometimes seem to be in a bad mood, or even offer extras that you are not in the mood for, such as chips or cookies, will be able to spend there with their friends who will find a nice place, where the bathroom is shared.\n"

      "We ate here during the World Cup - it was after 0-0 to call Brazil with Mexico, and there were a lot of unaccompanied men around the people! The place overlooks the Amazonas Theater and the main square next door, so it was therefore very crowded and the service was too slow. We had to do with a table indoors and upstairs, but if you can, try and get one of the tables on the balcony overlooking the theater. You may not find these issues right now the World Cup is over!However, when the food finally arrived, it was fantastic. I had the tambaqui ribs, which were great, the size of the pork ribs pieces! My friend had ordered a whole fish oa - it was huge, very much for one person, and the White fleshy pulp was perfectly cooked.It certainly costs 60 reais, about £ 16 or 17 pounds, but it was ideal for two people really.I can ignore the average service levels when the food is good.\n",

      "The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere ... however the waiting criterion is unintelligent (not to say dumb). No matter how many people you are in, be it 01, 02 ... or 20) your wait will follow the order, that is, if there is a wait for 20 people and you are in 04 people don't be excited if a table 04 seats ... because by the logic of waiting they will expect to vacate 5 tables of 04 to accommodate the 20 people in front of them. That's why the wait time to sit at the restaurant is at least 03 hours ... that's it. So the restaurant is always packed. Pure marketing. Conclusion: first and last time. Ah ... if the food is good? I do not know how to answer because after 4 hours of waiting in this dynamic super smart anything is a delight. It's like going to the supermarket hungry ... you want to buy everything you see ... lol.\n"

      "I got to know Wasabi through a collective shopping website that always offers promotions for the casters there. Every time I went with my boyfriend, I was very well attended, the girls who work there are super attentive, explain the whole menu to you and even tell you to try a hot philadelphia style makimono that only they have. Instead of seaweed around it, you have a super crunchy and delicious pastry and inside is a philadelphia. I never know his name and whenever I go there I give these characteristics to the waiters and they soon tell me the name so that I can place my order. In addition, the environment is super comfortable, cozy and very romantic, apart from the beautiful view you have, since it is all mirrored so that you can see the Lagoon. The sweet Harumakis are also delicious, especially the dark chocolate that you can still order with a bowl of ice cream. Nothing better than that to close your night after eating so many delights in this place. The pieces are of great quality, very small, fresh and everything is very tasty. The nira from there is one of the most delicious I've ever eaten, not to mention the skewers, which besides being grilled, are very well served. Really if you don't go to Wasabi through these promotions the price is quite expensive. At the weekend it is 92.90. Even in my opinion as an excellent restaurant, I don't think I would pay that much to go there, since there are other restaurants that are also very good and that serve me very well for a better and more affordable price.\n",

As it was mother's day and we imagined that the place could already have all the tables reserved, we called earlier at the restaurant so as not to miss a trip, in which we were informed that THERE WERE VACANCIES. However, when we arrived at the place at 11:30 am and it looks like WE WERE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE, THERE WAS NO ONE WAITING FOR THE TABLE. Then we were told that the restaurant only opened at 12:00. So far so good, we decided to wait. Later ANOTHER PERSON arrived after us and was passed in front of us. We questioned the fact and the restaurant staff DID NOT TAKE ANY ATTITUDE. When we went to complain about the situation, MAITREE with the biggest face came to say that he actually had a queue and had no table available, contrary to what was reported to us by phone, as mentioned above. Other people who arrived next and were also waiting were also revolted by the situation. So, ESCAPE FROM THIS RESTAURANT !!! TOTAL DISRESPECT AND ARROGANCE WITH THE CUSTOMER !!!\n",

      "I am a loyal customer of Kanpai Sul but I decided to give the Festival a chance since I had a discount coupon. I was well attended, the waiter was very polite and soon brought me the entrance and after that the dishes arrived very quickly for me. I just didn't like the hots very much, I found it dry, the cone hardened very fast.But the problem really started when I ordered a replacement. The tataki, which was perfect the first time, came with a lot of lemon juice, which made it very sour and hurt my mouth due to the high acidity (it was just one of the problems with the replacement).The pattern dropped as the restaurant filled up.I thought it was strange that there is no alternative menu for someone who doesn't go to eat at the rodizio (even if it was a yakissoba). Like, I can't go with friends who don't eat fish. Something that doesn't happen in the other Kanpais.I intend to return one day, who knows, to give another chance, but only because it is from the Kanpai family. Another place would not have that chance.\n",

      "Each time we go to Goiânia, we usually go to different bars or restaurants. The Obelisque is one of those places, where you go to eat, I liked it, we were attended by professional waiters, those who seem to work in the business for a long time, who know the menu, know how to serve and indicate good dishes.The food is plentiful, the dishes for two are well served, well done, in short, a good place to have lunch or dinner.\n",
      "Good atmosphere, great service and delicious food. Restaurant rated 10 for those who like tasting menu. Some tables in the lounge are a little glued which can take away some privacy. However, I recommend Oro for sure!\n",
      "Great atmosphere. Tasty food. Fair price. Good option to celebrate anniversary because it has a separate environment.\n",

      "It's the most beautiful Coco Bambu I've ever met. The biggest and most cozy. The service is excellent and the food is impeccable.\n",
      "I'm a fan of Pasta em Casa! Every time I was there, everything was very tasty. Very good service, beautiful and cozy space. I always visit at lunches so I take advantage of the pasta island that does not always have a menu that will please any palate as there are 3 dishes per day + protein. The price is reasonable to high but super recommended!\n",
      "A pleasant place for a perfect afternoon. I really enjoyed the facilities and service of the restaurant.The view of the Rio Vermelho sea is the highlight.The snacks were delicious and the caipirinha was delicious.Honestly the food left something to be desired. I had a spaghetti with bacon and shrimp (I don't remember the name of the dish, as it is a bit complicated), the shrimp was ready, but the pasta was very greasy. I didn't like it very much.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant with a more intimate proposal, peaceful and romantic atmosphere. Exceptional dishes, impeccable service !!I recommend to book early because there are few tables.\n",

      "It is located in the popular square, one of the busiest places in the city, air conditioned, the menu has snacks and snacks and there is always a DJ to liven up the night!\n",
      "The açaí from there is really good. However we ordered a fish board and we didn't like it because there was more crust than fish and the fish was not tasty. I think that on the menu I could explain that it is fried and breaded.\n",
      "Delicious food, but nothing extraordinary. Beautiful place is Bahia Marina. It does not compensate for the fact that you are a consumer for mosquitoes that enter the veranda, inside the restaurant, even with requests to close the entrance ... Ignored by the waiters ... They arrived saying the kitchen was closing, they turned off the air conditioning and they gave the guy that was broken.\n",
      "Good sandwiches, made with care and first-rate ingredients.We already ate tasty snacks there. My children and grandchildren also liked it. More than justified reason to recommend\n",
      "If you, like me, think Arab food is wonderful, this will become your favorite restaurant. Think about your favorite dishes and they do it perfectly.\n",
      "Yes, Claude really doesn’t settle: he opened another house in Leblon!After Chez Claude, neither Olympe is easy to evaluate, but here I give my impressions of Le Blond: the place is charming, well decorated, but noisy. I think it deserves some acoustic treatment so that we can have a good chat.Excellent food, although the service is very fast: amazingly, I think it's really bad to be very fast.The good table asks, for me, some time.Well: I think that here was the right measure to replace the Fashion Mall restaurant.That Italian trip in the Botanical Gardens never enchanted me and Dias Ferreira's meat shop didn't hook me, despite the years of long road.At Le Blond everything fits together (except the noise ...), respecting the evident differences for Chez Claude.I recommend, paying attention to the pots hanging from the ceiling!\n",
      "This tent was recommended by the guides because it works all year, but I found everything very expensive except the few things that were on sale. The service was very bad, until the person came to take care of you, it took time to bring orders, everything took time.I do not recommend\n",
      "On Sunday lunches the buffet is per kilo, with very good food, in a great atmosphere. They usually have live piano. It also offers desserts per kg. It has a small parking lot. The food is very varied, even for those who are very demanding.\n",
      "Excellent wine list. Pleasant environment.Background music and sophisticated dishes. There is space for a business meeting.\n",
      "Walking down the street, my wife was impressed with the dishes she observed on the outside tables, as the day was great we decided to sit outside and enjoy a real Italian lunch, primordial and in the right measure\n",
      "Cozy place, pleasant atmosphere with space for children and outdoor option, in addition to a beautiful and delicious Sushi. It is well worth paying and receiving good service and a great meal.\n",
      "we went to celebrate 21 years of marriage and ordered a ceviche festival, very tasty and accompanied by a sparkling rose with a fair price.\n",
      "Small but cozy atmosphere. Kind and effective service. Menu with classic, traditional pasta, well executed, with portions that serve two people, at an honest price. Good cost-benefit ratio.\n",
      "It was already very tasty and you walked for miles to eat a piece of a pie that melted in your mouth. Today it remains face to face or the whole cake, but the quality has dropped and you feel as if you were just eating an ordinary sponge cake as a mediocre filling. Normal and you better eat somewhere else if you love your pocket !!!\n",
      "A different pizzeria with a rotation of cold cuts and pasta, very cheap and with a very tasty and light pizza dough.The pizzeria has space to hold birthdays for adults and especially for children, as it has a playroom on the premises for children to have fun.The facilities are modern, quite spacious and cozy, combined with the service I found at first, I consider it a very good place for lunch / dinner or celebrations.Just go check it out !!!!\n"

But after the pantry, the menu was changed, and there was a poor menu and much more expensive. Today it is no longer full as before, which shows that customers are leaving. The poached is still very good.\n",

      "Delicious dishes, well served, with a wide variety of options and ... the best ... with very good prices. In addition to the menu, the facilities are excellent and there is also a wonderful playroom. In short, it is an unmissable restaurant on the edge of Aracaju. 😍\n",
      "I arrive on a sunny Sunday at 08.30hs in the tent with wife and bb of 11 months. ALL I said ALL the tables empty, even by the hour.I follow to a table that had a bigger shadow and at that moment the enlightened waiter tells me that I can't sit there because it's a table for 6 people.The local authority doesn't ask me if more people are going to arrive, it just says I can't.Anyway, I just said that in a crisis like this, the person is shooing the customer must be very rich.Ah he wanted me to stay on a tiny table with 100% sun on the soft spot.To avoid a greater evil I left.Anyone who wants to take the test and go to this tent.In order not to lose my beach I went to Barraca Duna Beach which is 1 km later and note 1000.GOOD LUCK WITH LOVE\n",

LOLUpon entering I found an extremely clean, pleasant environment, very polite waiters, not to mention the free salad buffet, I ate with friends, steak and filet mignon & it was awesome !!!\n",
      "Restaurant with pleasant ambience, excellent food. The price is a little expensive, but the food is worth it.\n",
      "Food very well made and tasty. It took a while to deliver the dishes, which was understood as the place was packed. We took the last vacant indoor table. Order the banana farofa.\n",
      "Cool of this bar are craft beers that are brewed on the spot. It tastes very good. I recommend the traditional one they call Pilsen.\n",
      "We had already been to the restaurant on 2 occasions, but this time we took my parents who reside in Portugal. The service provided by Van Damme was sensational. From the moment of choosing the table until the end of the dinner.It's great to see professionals who show their appreciation and talent for the work they do. I believe that there is nothing more fair than the recognition of the work performed by the waiter, as well as the quality of the meat served by the restaurant.The spicy meat empanadas are delicious and the ant sausage stuffed with provolone surprised.We chose Prime Rib and T-Bone as meats, both were delicious, but we left a highlight for Prime Rib, very marbled and soft.Congratulations to the establishment for having a guy like Van Damme in his professional body and for the quality of what he has on his menu.\n",
      "A very courteous service and a proper orientation on the dishes. I really enjoyed the main course and the dessert. It is worth coming and going back.\n",
      "La Positano strictly follows the BBB maxim - good, beautiful and cheap!The service is very good and the food is the same!For R $ 40.70 (service fee already included) it is possible to eat with the right to soda and dessert. Each day they offer 2 dish options in this system.The last time I went, on a Thursday, I opted against w / talharini with white sauce and chocolate mousse as a dessert. I recommend!Accept electronic ticket / meal voucher.\n",
      "Whatever type of typical dish you find there! Great flavor, pleasant atmosphere, excellent service !!!! Impossible not to leave with several extra pounds !!! But it pays off, especially for those who do not know much about Northeastern cuisine, it is good, as you can taste everything a little, because it is sef service! I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city, which by the way is beautiful!\n",
      "I ended up coming here without having programmed myself, because the bar at the front was packed. but I was surprised. I didn't know yet. the place has an interesting, charming lighting, the attendants are polite, the food is good. I found the price a little high when compared to the size of the pieces, but nothing that hindered the experience. They could improve the drinks part. I will be back for sure.\n",

      "In addition to having a delicious menu, like the fillet with fries that comes with a different sauce, picanha on the plate and drinks, it is very lively with live music. You can go 10 in the morning to drink that delicious coconut water or 9 in the evening to enjoy a ballad, feeling that breeze and the atmosphere of the place ... Anyone who goes to Maceio needs to go there. It is on the edge of Ponta Verde close to handicrafts ...\n",
      "Great night. Wonderful Teresa Rachel and perfect Caviar service !!!!! Good food, great wines and cold beer. I recommend!\n",
      "The restaurant is small and to get a table you must arrive in advance, but the wait is rewarding !! The meats are excellent and the side dishes, which are served on a rotating basis, are delicious! The service is also impeccable! A tip for 2 people is to try the Bisteca Fiorentina!\n",
      "Typical carioca bar that is always crowded. Tight environment and a little noisy. Varied and tasty foods but with a salty price for a cold bar.\n",
      "I have been a customer of Coco Bambú for a few years, I have always indicated it, but in the last few months, the service has left something to be desired, the food remains good, but they need to improve the service, sometimes the waiters seem to be doing you a favor, and it is an eternal answer: the waiter at this table is not me. I hope they get better, because the food is good and the atmosphere is pleasant.\n",
      "Out of fame, I sincerely expected more. Cold drink, very good juice ... As for the food, long dishes (the waiter himself warned). The dish we wanted to taste was not available when requested.\n",
      "it costs R $ 45.00 p / person and has good food ... you can take a photo for FREE with the baiana who is at the door and at night there is a folkloric bale show (I will not evaluate it because I didn’t appreciate it) ... restaurant with good view to the front of the church of san francisco ...\n",
      "Wonderful pizzas of various flavors, well prepared thin and well stuffed dough, super indicate well prepared pizzas!\n",

You can taste traditional moquecas or moquecas made with special ingredients from the Chef. which little is heard about. Be sure to try the biri-biri juice. It is worth returning to try the other dishes. Very friendly staff.\n",

      "The hairy guy q gives you the snack, he just doesn't throw it in your face, right, it would be ugly and the $ q you paid doesn't deserve so much rudeness. Expensive snack and nothing tasty. This draft beer you take out, it's a bag, there's no need to guide you and you take foam or debit your credit without getting the drink right. The band plays in a tiny space and you can't even hear the vocalist. Terrible!\n",

      "One of the best restaurants in town. It serves mainly Northeastern cuisine, mainly from Bahia.Order the mini entry acarajé is a delight! And the dessert chocolate souffle takes a while to be served, but it is worth every minute of waiting.As a main dish I recommend the moqueca, it comes with manioc flour with banana, rice and okra (if the side dishes are over, you can order more at no cost! I always need more okra!). The lamb shank with orange, sweet potato puree with gorgonzola is my favorite dish. For the less adventurous the high fillet with golden potatoes and rennet cheese is a great option. The atmosphere is great, the attendants very friendly and attentive. It has a kids term option.\n",

      "Carne de Sol 1008 reminded me a lot of the Chico do Churrasco belorizontino style - with the difference that, instead of the traditional accompaniment of garlic or tomato bread, here the generous skewers are garnished with meat paçoca and butter from the sertão. With tables played on football nights, there the beer is cold, the atmosphere is informal and the snacks are a must.\n",

      "I went to Las Chicas for the first time on 06/15, I arrived at 6:30 pm, there were only four people besides me, so I thought it wouldn't be long before I got there, but I was wrong, first I spent about 10 minutes waiting for someone answering, even a girl at the cashier seeing me there at the table alone, after 10 minutes I went there and asked if they were accepting asking and a guy came to answer me. I ordered a simple sandwich and a drink. In this, two of the four people who were already there, called the boy to ask if their request would take too long, that is, he was already late. After about 20 minutes that I had arrived, another girl arrived and in that time passes, what is my surprise when I see this girl who arrived after already receiving her order and I still nothing, then I went to complain to the boy who seemed not to know how to deal with the situation - and I really didn't know. Finally, I received my sandwich 45 minutes after I placed the order and the boy, perhaps out of shame, left my sandwich there very quickly, and left, not even asking if I wanted a napkin or anything, anyway ... it wasn't cool. The sandwich was okay, if I wasn't already so pissed, maybe I would have liked it. I prefer not to return.\n",
      "It was the second time I went to the restaurant! It was renovated! I called making the reservation that for lunch which is until 15:00 we ended up being late because the group was big and they were waiting for us even after the hours! Super abundant wonderful food and very affordable price! It is worth mentioning that the rapadura ice cream and the capim santo ice cream are wonderful! I recommend!\n",
      "The restaurant has a simple and relaxed atmosphere, but the food is excellent. The executive lunch maintains the quality of the conventional menu.I highly recommend whiting with seafood sauce and lemon risotto. Delicious!\n",
      "A charming place! Great infrastructure, perfect for resting !! Live music, massage, great drinks and delicious food! We love everything !! Without a doubt, this is what you thought about doing all year long on vacation, relaxing in front of the sea! Would definitely go back!\n",

      "In the first visits it was surprising the quality and quantity of the food, the service in the salon in my opinion always left something to be desired. The value was reasonable and still worth it. Nowadays it is expensive, the food, despite being large portions, is scarce and the waiters keep looking at the ceiling to not serve you.\n",

The portion of pastel is very expensive for the quality offered, wind pastels, the amount of filling was just ridiculous. Not worth the visit. High cost and no quality!\n",

      "The most tasty food there is. Large prawns, well-seasoned food and fair price. Wonderful service, the restaurant structure is beautiful, the desserts very tasty. It is very worth going.\n",
      "Everything excellent! The service was perfect, friendly, available, great suggestions and clarification of doubts in the right measure. My husband and I were very well attended. The environment is comfortable and very pleasant. Regarding the menu, I suggest the buffet. You have three options to choose from, with more or less varieties and with different values. We chose Premium, more complete. We have no regrets. The variety is immense and all very well prepared and delicious. Great cost benefit. I recommend!\n",
      "The restaurant has a very good atmosphere, including to take children, attentive and careful waiters, the food does not take long to arrive and it is always hot. The dessert was the chef's recommendation the first time, then we fell in love, roasted cocadinha with ice cream !! Worth going!\n",
      "I went with a large group on a Saturday night for drinks and dinner. When bringing the drinks (which cost an exorbitant R $ 40.00 each) the waiter did the feat of dropping three of the four glasses on the tray literally on top of my wife. His reaction was to stand still while the tray finished dripping on top of him, then murmur some kind of inaudible excuse and just disappear.He never came back, despite the fact that, already irritated by the rudeness, we had specifically asked the Night Manager, by the way the only polite and attentive person in the place, if he did not intend to apologize.It wasn't just that. You ask for water and the other waiter, who did not know who had asked, stops at the corner of a table of 8 people and starts shouting: - Water, Water !!!To complete, the breaded steak is massive and the entrecote we send back, with so much fat in the meat. The filet mignon tartare is worth it.\n",
      "I went by the recommendation of a friend. The restaurant is in Pelourinho and is very easy to find. The decor is very tasteful and the service is excellent. If she is lucky, she will be attended by Dona Dadá, but the day I went she was traveling abroad. Delight yourself with Bahian delicacies. The price is reasonable, but worth a try.\n",
      "Excellent food, pleasant atmosphere, excellent value for money. Very good top service, I recommend it and I will come back whenever I am in Porto Velho\n",
      "An incredible experience for the palate ... super cozy atmosphere, wonderful cuisine and a great selection of wines ...\n",
      "Located in a privileged location, Thiosty has everything to be an excellent restaurant. In fact, it's gone.It is poorly maintained, without innovations.Prices are at odds with quality.The cod rice is still very tasty.\n",
      "I loved this restaurant. In fact, there are two similar restaurants, very close: one very trendy, with a waiting list and such, and another on the other side of the track, much quieter and empty. I left the hotel to go to the first, gave up when I saw the line and went to the second. And it was the best thing I did! Great atmosphere, not so cheap food, but very plentiful. We were 4 friends, we only ordered one dish (breaded shrimp served with Piedmontese rice, if I'm not mistaken) and there was food left over! They say that the dish serves two people but served four and it still remains. I remember we split the bill and paid 25.00! I would never be able to eat so well at this price in my homeland. It was worth the experience, I'll be back there for sure!\n",
      "We went to lunch at this family restaurant, with high expectations. Unfortunately since the arrival it was just frustration. The service simply does not give the least attention. To order a drink was a challenge. To get menus then we don’t even talk about it - and when they brought it, there was only one for five people. But the worst was the food. Bad and tasteless. My son was in the carvery, but besides being super slow, it was also not good - the exception was the piglet pururuca. The owner was friendly, but kept parading canoles all the time instead of managing the waiters who provided a very bad service. To top it off, very expensive for what it serves. Without entry and without dessert we left 400.00 at the end. If it were good, it would be worth it, but due to the lack of quality it should cost half as much.\n",
      "Good option for those who want to kill the northeastern delicacies, with options even from Bode. I was not very lucky with the order, but I will be back to try the prawn and seafood rodizio. Piaba was a little older and I got frustrated. I tasted a feijoada that was very honest. Everything you have on the menu you can order at Delivery. Parking is non-existent, which makes access a little difficult, having to stop in the street next door, or in the establishments around. Very simple place, but very clean.\n",

      "Cájá has a very nice proposal and if you don't know it yet: just go. It will be an unusual experience with very delicious food.It is important to note that the dishes have a very prominent seasoning - plenty of pepper and ginger. It is a dichotomy that makes a lot of sense on the palate.The weak point is the lack of air conditioning and the delay for those in the queue.\n",
      "An option to catch up on the conversation, see elegant people from all tribes and still savor the delights that this restaurant offers.Krathong-thong - Thai baskets of crunchy dough, stuffed with chicken, corn and spices and Asian fillet is all good !!!!!\n",
      "Differentiated and unique environment, with a unique vibe and style. I loved the lighting and the great decor for photos and selfie. The guys at the house are wonderful, a big hug to dear Hanna, who was beautiful with the best tips and directionsWonderful food, canoe potato sauces are a sin 🙈The hamburger, juicy ... at the right point!Ps. What juice was that mine? Bloody lemonade 👏🏻Recommended, Find Hanna!\n",
      "We had a great meal and with a good service, the bathrooms are very clean and possibly we will be back on site next time we go to the city.\n",
      "Good music, beautiful people and cold beer. It just gets really crowded and there's a long line to get in, so get there early!\n",
      "Djapa is an interesting place, its quality is above average when compared to other casters, and it charges a fair price for the product delivered (R $ 65). In addition to the traditional salmon, tuna and white fish, it also brings sushi with roe and octopus sashimi, in addition to serving fresh oysters and gratin. The octopus carpacio and ceviche surprised The preparation of the fish and the hot dishes is very careful, the salmon in the papilote with shimeji and pineapple was great, the squid rings were very crispy and dry. The carvery also includes dessert, the options were ice cream, flambé banana, fruit salad and chocolate mousse. Pear ice cream deserves to be highlighted. I'll be back\n",
      "Bright environment, beautiful architecture, good service, delicious food, several sweets accompany the coffee, very delicate in the details, I would definitely return!\n"

      "Outside the central region's tourist itinerary, this fishmonger in the CPA neighborhood serves local fish prepared in the traditional way. Ventrechas of fried pacú, matrinxã and roasted peraputanga, mojica de pintado, not to mention the traditional banana farofa. The atmosphere is a little confusing and noisy, but nothing to beat the excellent taste of the dishes!\n",
      "Good service, pleasant location, adequate facilities. Surplus kitchen. Very traditional, worth visiting.\n",
      "I just ate a Maitre-style fish. It was wonderful. Only detail, the cook forgot the lobster that accompanies the dish. Still, the dish is great and the price is excellent.\n",
      "very small place, underneath, without any excitement to be a bar, mainly in Tatuape, expensive and bland\n",
      "Nice option: a beautiful house in Ipanema, wood oven, great ingredients and attentive service. The tables are spacious and the atmosphere is well lit. The pizzas are adequately priced (for Ipanema) and creative combinations. The entrée of shitake with heart of palm is tasty. Worth the visit for sure.\n",
      "Local with a very traditional atmosphere of BH bars and restaurants. But chef Oseas is a figure, super friendly and pleasant. And the dishes we ate at the circuit were great and well served.\n",
      "This is a place we love .... cuisine is good, service is good, but the best is ENVIRONMENT especially at night with the Piano in vivo, if you want a romantic dinner. The view from the pool is gorgeous.The only aspect I don't like much is the Ambient Bar ..... they need to be changed, it is better to have a drink at your table before diner !.\n",
      "Order a pizza at the end of the day, around 7:00 pm, and don't order anything else, there's no competitor, that's why he treats the customer so badly!The girls at the counter get rude and if you complain, they curse you ...The owner, with a frown, like someone who does you the favor of answering, cares little ...\n",
      "Very good, creative and tasteful dishes. Super attentive service, and what's cool, is that you are served by people who also cook (there are even some nice participants from The Taste Brasil there!). What is inevitable is the comparison with other tasting menus of the same level. The price, comparatively speaking, is higher than Lasai, for example, and offers a smaller number of steps. Overall it is great, but the cost benefit is not so favorable.\n",
      "Few Japanese food restaurants in Rio de Janeiro have an equal quality. Not very attractive prices, but worth every slice.\n",
      "Great for dinner with friends, the pasta is wonderful and tastes great. Service was also impeccable.\n",
      "Great variety to be served, pleasant and very creative environment. Very cozy. For this reason it is also quite crowded, but it has enough attendants.\n",
      "I really liked this restaurant, despite being caring it is a great option. We ordered a grilled tucunaré for two, which was delicious.\n",
      "Really flawless. I've been to several restaurants around the world with and without stars and this one surprised me a lot. Flavors of Brazil reinvented. And make no mistake, there are several very small dishes, but they satisfy and no one leaves hungry as many might find. Very expensive, but having what is unique and different, Vale, and a lot !!!\n",
      "Neighborhood candy store that grew a lot and maintained the quality. Great cakes and sweets, but also has delicious snacks.Accept order.Price matches quality.\n",

      "I went with my family to dinner and we loved the food. There was live music and it was a delight our night,\n",
      "The house is lovely, few places on the balcony and a pleasant atmosphere inside.No Indian decor, just little touches that refer to culture.Attentive waiters, patient to explain the menu is very friendly.Good Indian food, a very rare specialty in the gastronomic panorama of Rio de Janeiro.Masala came with little pepper, as it seems that this is the standard of the house, but you can ask them to add more when ordering (I prefer it that way). Nan was very tasty. I recommend!\n",
      "Think of a tasty food that tastes like I want more! And the best: with a fair price !! I will definitely come back and recommend it to everyone! Service note ten also ... ...\n",
      "be sure to go to Cameroon and order the black cheff, the restaurant is refined and super clean, specializing in seafood. the price is very good, the restaurant appears to be a very expensive restaurant, but it is not.\n",
      "I went with my husband and a couple of friends and shot at the feijoada buffet. Tasty and with the accompaniments you should always have, orange, kale, flour, breaded banana and still has a aimpim cake that I died eating! It's to stick your foot in the jackfruit! Honest value and for the couple it is nice (an average of 50.00 per person with drink).\n",
      "Tasty buffet option in the Gardens with varied food and choice of soups aside, efficient and friendly service\n",
      "Excellent dishes and an interesting combination of flavors.Enjoy the Risotto with leeks, accompanied by a hamburger with sweet potato sauce.\n",
      "One of the most welcoming places I have ever visited ... Must-see for those of Italian descent ... The place is in an old house, with wooden floors and decorated with several black and white photographs on the walls ... Very simple, but very elaborate in the details. Excellent food, very attentive service.\n",
      "The Rox Bar is an eccentric restaurant featuring regional cuisine named after famous artists. The menu is varied. I just didn't like the delay.\n",
      "I went for indications of the other evaluations and they are really fair. Focused on beef ribs, of excellent quality, it also has pork ribs and pururuca. And the legitimate gaucho mayonnaise. It is worth knowing and savoring.\n",
      "The place is beautiful! The bar is inside a hotel that has wonderful architecture! We sat inside the bar by the window, enjoying the sound of the piano and sax, all very comfortable ... The extremely friendly and patient waiters to help us choose our drinks because we didn't know many of the ingredients! Lol the result was a wonderful evening with friends, conversation and different drinks with exotic flavors!\n",
      "I went on Friday 05/04/19 and it was a total mess. The only dish that came was horrible, with bad vinegar. The other dishes didn't come, I waited for hours and nothing, in short: I left without eating. The house uses a tablet system that doesn't work. The idea is good, but it doesn't work.\n",
      "This steakhouse was a great option!And very pleasant, the service and impeccable staff are attentive and helpful.The varied and tasty buffet!And the songs that are played on the piano are tops the pianist and talented, eclectic! I'll be back there for sure.I recommend everyone in João Pessoa to go to the Sal e Brasa steakhouse, it's worth checking out!\n",
      "In general, the restaurant is excellent. I will briefly describe the experience.We went on a weekday during January / 2017, but even though it was theoretically a low-moving season, I preferred to book early to avoid problems. In this way, we booked a table for two (couple) by phone.We arrived at the agreed time on the reservation and were directed to our table. A giant table (maybe for 8 people). We thought it was kind of weird, but we sat down. The waiter must have noticed our estrangement, and immediately asked if we would prefer another table (more cozy) and directed us to a smaller table (without having actively requested it). This type of proactive action demonstrates respect for customers and quality of service.Soon we received the menu and wine list. The restaurant has several options, cheff suggestions, dishes for 1 and for 2, etc. Prices are variable, but don't expect a plate with fast food chain sandwich prices! We ordered starter and main course. Both were delicious, worth every penny and all the effort of the restaurant staff. Soon after we ordered the desserts, which were very tasty, but perhaps not on the same impressive level as the dishes.The only caveat I make is in relation to the wine list. It was the only moment that I found the cost-benefit terrible. We ordered a French pinot noir that was far from being worth the amount charged. I tried wines in France for 5, 6, 8 euros much higher than the one offered by the house (which cost no less than 10x the amount quoted). National and other countries' wines were also overpriced. But as we went for the food and the experience, and as I only asked for 1 bottle, I did not consider this detail in the final note.In general, I recommend the restaurant. But I will probably ask for juice next time.\n"

      "Food per kilo around R $ 40.00. Many typical dishes. It is in the Albano Franco handicraft market. I loved the tapioca ice cream with flambé banana and cinnamon sauce R $ 10.00, I even went back the other day just for dessert kkk it was delicious tapioca ice cream with red fruit sauce and the espresso served with a banana quiche was also very good and only R $ 3.50! I highly recommend it. The a la carte menu found the prices salty compared to other restaurants on the waterfront\n",

      "Without a doubt the worst pizzeria in São Paulo. My parents and I bought SALMONELLA and were sick for 1 week. This is all thanks to the lack of responsibility of Dom Lau Pizzaria in the handling, preparation and lack of asepsis in the preparation of their pizzas.I even thought about filing a lawsuit, but because it was always out of the country it was not feasible.I've eaten in several pizzerias around the world and what Dom Lau Pizzaria has done is abusive.The discomfort it caused my family deserved some punishment.Anyway, I don't recommend anyone to stay away and preserve their physical health.\n",

      "Dishes well prepared and served, serve 3 people well, note service 10, the attendant Ana Paula and is an example of a professional,Congratulations to all for the harmonization of the dishes.\n",
      "The atmosphere is pleasant and fine, but the quality of the food served at the self-service is very poor; it has no special ingredients and no prime meat. So the price is not worth what they charge. On weekends they still charge 10% more service, but you are the one who serves yourself (self-service!). That is, which service? Still, they do not warn you about this charge. I only knew it because I questioned the cash value. I won't be back.\n",
      "Impeccable quality of the food, I liked everything I tasted! Very approved! And the price is worth it because the portions are large.\n",
      "The decoration, the music and the public that frequents it. All very good !!! I highly recommend it, as I believe it remains one of the best places to go in Rio de Janeiro.\n",
      "Great value for money, the menu pleased me. The service and facilities also met expectations.\n",
      "We ate an indescribable 4cm medallion of good, and the plate for 2 served 3 loosely!The pineapple jam with pepper is a must, and they sell it to take home ($ 25).We are sure that we will return on this trip.\n",
      "Fantastic place. Quiet beach, great for children. Good leisure structure with small children's pool, freshwater showers, playground. Several bungalows with a hammock and sun loungers. The cost of 25 per person is more than fair. Good music with sound at the right time, cold beer (not much variety unfortunately), great snacks with fair prices for the place. I highly recommend it and I will definitely return on a next visit to Maceió.\n",
      "Boteco Arrumadinho is very good to go with friends to have a beer and eat some snacks. Very pleasant.\n",
      "Nice place, with excellent service and good music.Apart from the hamburger, which is already known and veryoo tasty, I suggest the petit gateau of dulce de leche ... it's irresistible !!!!\n",

      "Berg's great receptivity is already the fourth time we have been to The W Restaurante.👍👏👏👏👏👏👏 It is also worth mentioning Crisaldo's wonderful service.\n",
      "Very good service !! We didn't eat there, we just drank, but the prices weren't expensive, I thought it was fair! The problem is that it only opens at 10 in the morning lol ...\n",
      "We went to celebrate my wife's birthday. Despite the odor impregnated with smoke, very loud ambient music we ordered the sun meat and side dishes and a cold one (of the menu options there were only 3 options).The second beer was hard to be served, so we almost went to get it.Our order arrived, the carne de sol (should be called: MEAT OF SALT) very hard and dry and the side dishes lacked something moist., We gave up asking for more drinks because they forgot about us! The live show started and the sound volume was extremely loud.We decided to ask for the bill and again without success, I went to the cashier and asked, the service fee was charged and I asked what service ?! Immediately the cashier excluded her, but I waited a long time because, as I was the first customer to pay the bill, they had no change.WE GIVEN BEER AND JUICES, THE LIVE SHOW BEGAN WITH THE EXTREMELY HIGH VOLUME .; AS IT DIDN'T ATTEND US, I HAD TO GET UP AND GO TO THE BOX TO REQUEST THE ACCOUNT THAT AT THIS TIME, IS INCREASED WITH THE SERVICE FEE.I INQUIRED THIS COLLECTION AND I WAS READY SERVED, BUT THE BOX HAS NO EXCHANGE, WAIT ... .SAD CHOICE!\n",
      "Very traditional restaurant in the city, at the beginning it was a small bar at the top of Protásisio. Chopp and open sandwich was the order. Great! Then I discovered the German food that they serve as the fillet stuffed with white sauce. Magnificent! Accompanied by the best potato salad in town. And the unbeatable yellow mustard that is very strong but that harmonizes very well with the dishes. Today Printz has changed its address and may no longer have the charm of Protásio's small restaurant. But the food that matters is still delicious !! Super recommend!\n",
      "Right away I loved the rustic ambience of Mangai, a very diverse self-service, with a huge plate to put various delicious things to try the foods com. There it also has a bakery, and sell some souvenirs of the place. It was worth knowing.\n",
      "Great. Located in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. Offers lunch, snacks, juices, vitamins, milk, soft drinks, among other things. Everything is of the highest quality.\n",
      "Tete is one of the best restaurants in Campo Grande ... excellent food and impeccable service ... We highly recommend exotic cod and dried meat risotto ... Chef Tete makes a point of talking to customers about the dishes, offering thus, a different treatment. We love the restaurant and highly recommend it.\n",
      "Excellent place to try typical Minas Gerais food. Tasty food!!! It is difficult to choose the dish with so many options.As it was the first visit I went to the traditional Mexidoido Chapado !!Before noon it was already full.I'll be back to try other dishes\n",
      "The quality is excellent and the service very good. The price is right considering what you deliver to customers. Worth checking out!\n",
      "Self service à kilo located in the Docks. The restaurant offers organic and natural food. It differs from other self services because it does not seem to make food on a large scale, giving an idea and appearance of homemade food, made with greater care. The food is simple but very well seasoned and emphasizes regional cuisine, iporém with more lightness. It also offers natural and organic products to take home.\n",
      "Not to mention the excellent Menu, the Restaurant has a wonderful view, a very cozy rustic atmosphere and a high level service.\n",
      "We ate pasta and lasagna made fresh, of various flavors it comes warm, bubbling the cheese, it is worth having a meal in this environment.\n",
      "Beautiful view and great service. If you want entry, it is worth trying the heart of palm. The octopus was delicious, in the right spot. Finally, I loved the chocolate pie with chestnuts.I find it very interesting to have the UBER promotion when making a reservation on the restaurant's website.\n",

When the place is full, the waiters get a little lost and the service is compromised. The juice is hot, the atmosphere is very tight for the number of tables.\n",

I like the fact that the food is served as a buffet, because you use what you like and the people who are with you too. The service is also very good. It is one of my favorite restaurants.\n",

      "I didn't know this bistro in the Horto neighborhood, close to my home in Santa Tereza. I found the menu very varied. I opted for a gnocchi with shredded meat, which was divine. My husband had the fungi risotto with delicious fillet. The gnocchi and stuffed pasta are made right there. I believe everything is good. The service was very cordial. I will recommend a lot and come back, as the price is also better than most canteens. Only the wines that end up making the bill more expensive, with the latest tax increases, although the prices there are fair.\n",
      "What about a restaurant where you returned twice more on a trip?The service is excellent, we were pleased to be served by exceptional people who made our dinner even more enjoyable.The dishes and pizzas are excellent, well served and we were really satisfied with everything.If you choose to go on the day that has special attractions like stand up, arrive early :)\n",

      "I was at the restaurant as recommended by co-workers, that is, I went with positive expectations, however I was not very lucky. We arrived around 13:30 and the restaurant was quiet and without many customers, we ordered a tambaqui band, and at the beginning a broth (which never arrived) we waited a long time, even when the order arrived, even though we chose rice, we they served baião, the attendant went to change, and it took some more time to bring the rice, or rather, one of our friends went to the kitchen to get it ... well, I didn't have a good impression, mainly because the waiters were hovering over the smart headphones that, I believe, were for taking orders, but I don't know what they did so much with the 'gadgets' to be so entertained and disconnected.\n",

      "Finally, a decent restaurant for lunch at the airport, 14Bis on the 3rd floor is absurdly expensive and the food is not good.

In addition to a super welcoming atmosphere, the staff treats you like a VIP. I loved it.\n",

      "I really like the restaurant because the buffet is always full of food (mainly sashimi) and, unlike other Japanese restaurants, I have the freedom and agility to get only what I want.\n",
      "A nice place and seems to be frequented by the high society of POA. Very good menu, but a little expensive. The only thing that caught my attention was the existence of only one bathroom for everyone who attends there ...It is worth having a coffee there!\n",
      "Messrs. Alcivanio & Evandro, in a unique way in the tone of Coco Bambu, attended me in an excellent and good taste.\n",
      "Excellent service, good food with good temperature, hygiene, speed and attentive waiters. Safe environment with many leisure options.\n",
      "The pizza is wonderful, it makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Best of all, it's a 24-hour restaurant.The food is also very good, I'm in love with Filé Stalos.\n",
      "Ideal for aperitifs, this bar has remained good over the years. Very cold drink, Brazilian and German snacks, make this place an option without error!\n",
      "I went to celebrate my engagement with my fiancee on the spot. Pleasant atmosphere and very ambient music, point for the play list that was very romantic. We liked the service, the waiter suggested great suggestions for dishes. She opted for a baby beef and I for a pouvo with accompaniment. As a drink we opted for a non-alcoholic strawberry drink. Everything was wonderful and to close the night, a very personalized dessert in our honor.\n",
      "Nice place, good service, very small and you have to wait in line. Good option for sushi carvery.\n",
      "Various juices and snacks. And there is something for everyone, from the huge snacks with picanha burger, bacon and cheddar to the egg whites omelet with chicken and Minas cheese (which, although healthy, is huge too). It also has delicious sweet tapioca. Great place to grab a snack after the beach.\n",
      "Pleasant environment, without much freshness, space not too big but well distributed. Bathroom with difficult access, with spiral staircase, wheelchairs and people with walking difficulties not even thinking about going. To choose what to eat the melhoe is to stick to the menu presented with two options to choose from, starter, first dish, second and dessert. good quality and very good taste. Interesting to know.\n",
      "very cool, excellent food, good space, I really liked it. for sure i will come back, adoreiiii a lot, perfect attendiment\n",
      "Excellent service. Very good food.Wonderful environment.The managing partner mr. Virgílio is very attentive.We would like to pay a special compliment to the waiters who served us, Peter and Caleb, who were very kind, polite and efficient.We indicate the restaurant and we will be back for sure.\n",
      "While waiting for my flight schedule, I had lunch at this restaurant. It is a self-service per kilo. Very varied and tasty food. Worth it.\n",
      "Delicious place !! Serves super tasty drinks and food with very fast service. In addition, it has super clean bathrooms. Super nice environment to go with family or enjoy the beach with friends.\n",
      "Quality food and a cozy atmosphere. It is an expensive restaurant, but it is worth the experience. The attendants, although initially helpful, could be a little more friendly. I found the dishes a little spicy but very tasty.\n",
      "Very tasteful environment, soft lighting, all brand new! Very varied menu, from northeastern to eastern food! Great variety also in the part of the drinks. Reasonable price. On Fridays and Saturdays, at night, there is live instrumental music, completing the restaurant's charm. Thankful surprise!\n",
      "Going to Natal, don't miss this wonderful seafood restaurant. Very tasty dishes, very well served and with no salty prices. Very beautiful and pleasant environment, first quality professionals. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!\n",
      "Apart from Rock in Rio, it was the only thing that was worth it in Rio!Good portions.Very good service!\n",
      "The place recently opened by the Fazano Group is very pleasant, installed next to the Ipanema sidewalk and with good taste. We were there on a very hot summer afternoon in Rio with a group of friends for drinks and snacks. Very friendly staff, but the service was extremely slow. The draft beer arrived at a reasonable temperature and the snacks are good enough. The problem was really the kitchen that doesn't seem to be able to handle it when the house is full. At least, he couldn't handle that beautiful afternoon ...\n",
      "Arrive early, as 13h already had a queue and it was not high season. The place is cozy, facing the sea and there is a wide choice of dishes based on seafood. Almost all dishes are for two people and are very well served. We ordered a breaded shrimp with cashew nuts, my wife and I couldn't handle the dish. The desserts are too much, we left the place wanting more.\n"

      "It is a pleasant place, good atmosphere, treatment, service, fair price. Nice food. Anyway, a place with nothing much, but that I recommend to my friends because I also have nothing to complain about.\n",
      "I received so many recommendations to taste the shrimp served there, but I was not surprised. Difficult place to reach, the restaurant is a little cramped, the food has its flavor, but I didn't like it. I would not return.\n",
      "This chain of fast food restaurants appeared in Porto Alegre and is found in the main shopping malls in the city. The service is fast and the food is excellent!\n",
      "The place is apparently pleasant, but there is a delay in the service that has no explanation. That's because the bar was empty. We ordered a beer. The waitress brought a lukewarm bottle but already poured the glasses. When we experienced it was that disappointment. After saying that the beer was hot and asking for a change, the girl left us waiting while talking to someone in the kitchen because we had also asked for a snack. The delay was long and when I went to the counter a boy said that the refrigerator was defective! And nothing was freezing. That is, why was it not warned? Do they think: since they are at the mall in Gávea everything can be a differential. But for us it was a big difference. we left the mall and went to a bar next door with a super cold beer, a good-humored waiter, in short a place!\n",
      "each calorie is worth it. whatever flavor you choose, you will not regret it. Light mass that melts in your mouth. Preferred flavors are: CHOCOLATE (make sure to eat this flavor), beef jerky with catupiry cheese, pepperoni and the traditional cheese. Master.\n",
      "Number one in service, quality and beauty of the dishes. Gabriel and Cacau are extremely affectionate with customers. It is worth tasting the Duo do Mar and the Steck of Filet Mignon with emental risotto and red fruits. You have to know.\n",
      "Restaurant with a cool animation, nice service, with an assorted menu and great tequileiras\n",
      "For those who like variety, this is the place. I found other restaurants with better dishes, but only in this one you have great variety and can try a little of each.\n",
      "The Bessa Gril restaurant is a good option for happy H. There is a promotion until 8 pm, with interesting portions and affordable value. Afterwards, the dishes and portions are reasonable, normal price. It tastes good and the service is reasonable.\n",
      "the food is excellent, drinks always at the ideal temperature, excellent service, a clean place with pleasant people.\n",
      "I really enjoyed having lunch at Oliva and I always go there. But yesterday I invented going for a pizza carvery at the restaurant, thinking it would be as good as lunch. Advice: do not go to the carvery. The carvery is too expensive for the flavors of the pizza they offer: cheese and ham, marguerita, chicken, pepperoni, and the best were four cheeses and peperoni and only once did a shrimp. I have already been to rodízios of the same value with a variety of larger pizzas and less common flavors. In addition, the place was not full and the pizzas took a lifetime to reach the table (imagine if the place was full).\n",
      "We came to Caminito for an indication. We were told that the service was impeccable, that the meat was served at the perfect spot and that the dessert was divine. We checked each item above and, yes, that's all. Ah, a highlight for Vandame. Waiter who attended us as if we owned the restaurant ... kkkk.Ass: couple 20\n",
      "has a real variety of creamy chocolates with cachaça not to forget the spicy ones .. various flavors and fruits.\n",
      "Impeccable service. Wonderful place in Pajuçara. First-rate parasol chair. DJ tb was all top. Only the price of beer I found a bit pulled but the rest ended up being worth it. Place of beautiful and rich people! 😂\n",
      "Beautiful, cozy, air-conditioned, perfect environment.Very polite and well educated waiters. No comments !The food is sensational, a vast menu of both food and wine.Ordered dish: grilled prawns in bread and garlic crust with green salad and hearts of palm accompanied by lemon risotto.Dessert: banana pie with cinnamon and ice cream, divine!Finally, we ate very well and were very satisfied!\n",
      "Rodizio of pizzas, crepes, tasty pasta and fresh salads! All this combined with attentive waiters and the cost / benefit is great !!!\n",
      "What draws attention are the typical costumes of men with leather hats from the canganceiros. What pleases most are the typical and delicious dishes of Northeastern food. You know you want more.\n",
      "Great!!! Wonderful service and food !!! Paraná always excellent in its service ... Music of good taste and decoration of extreme good taste !!! I recommend!!!\n",
      "best restaurant per kilo I've ever eaten. impeccable food and service. the cuisine ranges from Peruvian to Italian dishes. I doubted it, but after yesterday I found out what good, beautiful and cheap food is\n",
      "Great service. Excellent fish rotation. If you prefer, you can choose an a la carte dish. Free buffet with severalfollow-up options anddesserts. It is worth checking.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant, delicious food and good service. The tartufo lasagna was perfect, the cod was spotless and the pistachio pudding was very good.\n",
      "Delicious Temakis with great price! It is worth eating at this restaurant. There is also a buffet service without a scale for 15 reais (I think).\n",
      "I really liked my choice (Bák Gigante), very tasty, well located, the preparation took a little time, but it was worth it. The price is fair, very comfortable and organized. I recommend!\n",
      "For those of us who already knew some of Jamie's restaurants around the world, expectations were high. The experience, on the other hand, could not have been worse. Bad we arrived and ordered the drink. The moment the waiter was serving them, he unintentionally dropped 3 glasses of orange juice onto my shirt, my wife's white blouse and the Fendi bag she bought a few months in Italy and I prefer to decline the price. The attempt to deal with the mess caused could not have been more disastrous as it had no structure to deal with this type of accident. To make matters worse, they offered a $ 40 discount for an account over $ 500 and thought they were doing them a favor. As for the dishes themselves the quality is very questionable not to say median down. A horror in all aspects, except for carpaccio. Both in treatment and in flavor it is aPlace that I will never return. Really one of the worst of my life and look that I have had several problems like this, however, I have never been so badly attended !!!!!\n",
      "I was there on two occasions in November 2015: a Sunday lunch and a Friday night dinner.On Sunday, although I found the food and service very good, the fact that it was very crowded affected the quality, even without having completely compromised the final result. I realized this coming back a week later for dinner on a night with reasonable movement, but not explosive.The food was very tasty, there was an option for children who prefer something closer to barbecue / grilled meat and ate very well. The friendliness and good humor of all the waiters, with their different regional accents, are unique.Worth it!The tip is to program yourself to avoid queues and overcrowding.\n",
      "Located on Via Costeira, it is a great restaurant with a sea view. Super nice place with excellent service. Good value for money. The restaurant offers typical northeastern food that is mouth-watering. Oh, oh ... I miss the sun meat, the milk rice, the fried cassava and the bottle butter ...\n",
      "I loved the atmosphere of the place and the waiters were very friendly and helpful (congratulations waiters Marcus and Bruno!).At the beginning we ate the pair of crayfish in the katsuobutter, which was delicious - this pair is a must.I ordered the chef's mixed sashimi and didn't regret it. Excellent quantity and fish that I didn't know (including one called sawfish that was spectacular).Another order I recommend is the Gunkans (I ordered the tuna pair). It was delicious!The serve of the house is also very good. Very soft.We were a little disappointed with the hot dishes. Tonkatsu had very unpleasant nerves and Ramen didn't have much flavor.In short: I recommend going to eat the cold dishes and forget the hot ones!\n"

      "It is a good restaurant, but I didn't like the cost-benefit aspect. Dishes too expensive for what they offered.\n",
      "Great food, price a little salty, environment gets sun so it gets very hot. When we went many broken chairs without maintenance.\n",

      "Fabulous food, cozy place and friendly owners. I am passionate about Middle Eastern food and whenever I travel I look for restaurants that serve it, but, luckily for me, the best of all I have ever met is here in Campo Grande!\n",
      "Upward atmosphere, very cool. Inconvenient in addition to the difficulty of parking is the delay in service. Dishes and especially drinks are more expensive.\n",
      "I met through the referral of a friend and fell in love. The service is always very polite and friendly. I feel very well treated. Everything I ever ate there was excellent. Although there are several in RJ, I still think this unit is the best.\n",

      "The environment is comfortable and has a good view of the sea. The dishes are varied within the proposal of the restaurant. The food is excellent! I recommend!\n",
      "The cappuccino I ordered did not please me, the person who made it has no experience in preparing it, it is not because of the amount I paid but because of the way it was made, it would be much better to have drunk a simple coffee, I hope I have helped in the research for future preparations of staff and teachings on how to make a cappuccino.\n",

      "Rustic and at the same time fine environment. Very pleasant and the menu is neat. The value could be better, but it's worth it!\n",
      "I think it's a super negative point that they don't accept cards. The sandwiches are very coarse. Well stuffed, it's true. For those looking for quality and something gourmet, I do not recommend it. For those who want to fill their bellies and pay a reasonable price, this is the place.\n",
      "Montana Restaurant is located inside Porto Velho Shopping, offering a very varied menu of food. It is a great choice for those who are passing through the Mall.\n",
      "I arrived with my wife to get to know the place, it takes 15 minutes for a waiter to arrive and serve us ... we ordered 2 pieces of pizza each (already anticipating the delay), 30 minutes later the waiter tells me to change the flavor, because it doesn't have the ingredients, another 30 minutes to finally be served ...The pizza is nothing special, nothing worth the high price.Just highlight the environment, and the location, but that lousy service and excessive greed of the owner, (few employees and all newbies), amazed me from there to never again!\n",

Praised there, praise deserved here. Very good food, prices slightly below those in Lourdes, service above those in Lourdes. They started very well and that they continue in this direction ... congratulations. An addendum that I commented to management today, Tripadvisor sends to an address that is not the right one. I got out of the uber and walked a block to find it. They stayed to correct.\n",

      "Excellent, very good, quality food, unparalleled service, environment for all types of meetings!\n",

      "A certain delay in the arrival of the dishes, but the Japanese is of good quality and the atmosphere is pleasant. The number of sashimi blades (10 units) per person could be higher for the basic rotation.\n",
      "I was at the restaurant on 12/31 and was very well attended by the waiter Rubens. Cold beer, the crab on the beaches of Natal. I still need to buy more sunbeds or fix broken ones. I had a problem with my card at the time of payment. I left my cell phone number with the manager. I used tables 255 2 252. I wait for her to call me on whatsapp so I can settle the pending issue. I will always come back.\n",
      "Maybe it was unfortunate this day, because the dish took a long time (2 hours), but I wouldn't mind if the dish was good, however, the most expensive meat dish in the house can NEVER be too salty, too long, too long dry and very hard.The wine was good.\n",
      "I love going to hamburgers, but I always gave up going to Bravo because it was always very crowded.Today I went to Bravo da Barra and it was not crowded, I had a table to sit in, the wonderful atmosphere of Vila Pereira.Excellent service since arrival, very tasty burger.Totally recommended.\n"

      "We went to the restaurant yesterday. Arriving we were very well received and we were shown the complete environment.We chose the buffet because, seeing the table full of typical dishes, our eyes were filled with the desire to eat everything. As I am a little afraid of Northeastern food because I am strong, I preferred to eat a little bit of everything that had sunny meat ... because I love it .. .my dish was beautiful .... my husband has already eaten mutton .. good a little bit of everything and left very satisfied ... recommended the place. It is very worthwhile to go .we went early ... at 7.30pm auction quickly .... we loved it\n",

      "Very good restaurant. One of the best I've ever been here in BH. I highly recommend it. Mainly, the service of the waiter Reginaldo. Very friendly person, fast and always looking to meet what we requested.I advise just making a reservation before you go, as the place is always crowded.The food is extraordinary, delicious.The atmosphere is beautiful, with very nice live music.I loved everything!\n",

      "Friendly service, pleasant atmosphere and very familiar. Pizza with shocking dough and well stuffed at honest prices. Great choice in Maceió.\n",
      "Great choice for a quick snack. The jerky, cod and dulce de leche are the best (my opinion). The price is also fair (R $ 3.30 at Shopping Mangabeira).\n",

      "They have many varieties of pizzas, more than 50 different. I confess that I didn't know how to choose the flavor of our pizza, I found the two flavors, delicious pasta and the affordable price a bit sickening. Attentive waiters and nice place.\n",
      "It is certainly a great option for lunch on any day. It presents excellent northeastern food. Reasonable prices. All dishes are very hearty and with many side dishes, one better than the other. I recommend you to enjoy the meat of sun, which is wonderful, and comes with many good things, such as the fried manioc which is divine. It's worth the visit.\n",
      "Abusive price to what is offered. Portion well served for one person, but nothing unusual, despite being signed by a chef.Brigadier spoon 16.00 but it is very big and tasty, not worth the value!Ana Restaurante wins in a rush.\n",
      "Face from a very mineiro bar, cozy and good food describe it. this restaurant that is on the second floor of the BH municipal market. Great tip !!\n",
      "There are several portions and always very cold beers. The service is good but the last time I was there I found the price a bit steep. I do not recommend staying late because the street has no movement after 9 pm.\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, wonderful service by the waiter Evandro, always with good directions and prompt service !!\n",
      "De Bruer is a small bar specializing in craft beers in Vila Madalena.Away from the bustle of the village, it is an excellent place if you are looking for tranquility and like special beers. The price is right and it is possible to drink craft beers from all over Brazil. I suggest you try the Rota do Cerrado beer, from Uberlândia.To eat, the ribs, with different types of sauces, are unbeatable. It melts in your mouth. The only point is that the portion is small and serves only two hungry people.\n",
      "Unusual PF this PF is not necessarily Indian, but decorated as such. It offers a dish of the day or an option, which is a variation of the first. The formula varies according to the day of the week and thus we have good, healthy, differentiated and cheap food. My tip is: order half a meal to try and then repeat the items that interest you, paying a small amount for the portion.\n",

      "Very simple restaurant too much, but expensive, I asked for a lamb that came super salty, toasted and bathing in the fat, I ordered it back, I paid for the beer which, by the way, is also horrible and I left, good, just the waiter who was very kind\n",
      "I went to dinner at this restaurant and I really liked the taste and the atmosphere. The pasta island (3 released pasta) works only for lunch, which frustrated me a little because I wanted to know a greater variety. It has an open part and the closed environment (air-conditioned). We paid 140 for 2 people, with dessert, without alcohol.\n",
      "Very good food. Typical food of the region. Decorated house. Very good service. Price consistent. It's really worth it.\n",
      "Cozy place, ample space divided into two rooms, great location, great service. Feel yourself in Portugal by enjoying the different cod dishes that serve two people well and the sound of classic Portuguese music, Fado, played on Thursdays. So, let's go to the typical cuisine: roasted cod with roasted potatoes, cod on the tile, Gomes de Sá cod, Zé do Pipo cod, lagareiro cod, João do Grão cod. Traditional cuisine: broiler on the grill, fish fillet with shrimp sauce, imperial chicken on the grill. Wines: lean list, made up of classic Portuguese reds and whites, including some cuts. Desserts: frozen cream milk, açaí ice cream, milk pudding, frozen pie. Place to return more than once, whether for business, family or as a couple.\n",
      "Simple and incredibly tasty, I think these are the two words that best reflect this restaurant. Reduced menu, fair prices, and unmatched quality. I made a reservation 90 minutes before and everything was great. Valuable service. Worth the visit.\n",
      "They make a very tasty patty. It's worth trying! The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff are kind. It is well filled and the dough is wonderful.\n",
      "Excellent rodizio, with several options of fish, shrimp and even Japanese food. Wide location and good service. Fair price for the service and quality it offers.\n",
      "We know the restaurant through a collective shopping website and we have no regrets. We bought the free sequence and it's wonderful. Tasty fish. Great service: fast and attentive. We will be back for sure.\n",
      "The assessment of this place leaves us tied up in words. The place is cozy, intimate and of excellent taste. We made a reservation on a full Tuesday, but it was not necessary, since there were few tables occupied. We were attended by Carol, who provided us with excellent service, being didactic and presenting the menu, wines and olive oils with excellence. We ordered a cod with cream and it was divine. We ordered a Portuguese wine that was wonderful, although expensive, since the same wine to take cost 50% less. The dessert was great. The bill was fair to the location, quality and service. Recommended.\n"

      "High priced snack bar but the snacks are delicious and worth every penny they cost ... I intend to return!\n",
      "I really liked it, the price is not so affordable, but it's worth it. I recommend the mixed Moqueca and the tapioca ice cream, without a doubt it is an excellent combination.\n",
      "Nice place. Valet, varied menu and excellent service. Simple but tasteful decor that snuggles and leaves the customer at ease. Coming here, be sure to taste the Clericot (photo) and the award winning empanadas.\n",
      "How to describe a lunch at Ristorantino ... FANTASTIC, AMAZING, DELICIOUS !!!! We arrived for lunch at around 3pm on Saturday ... We were DIVINELY attended by TWO CRAQUES TO ATTEND AND SERVE ... Jeff and Raimundo !!!!!! Congratulations to both of you for making lunch the Maximum !!!! We don't need to touch the menu !!!! That's right !!!! We start with an Italian Fasano sparkling wine with excellent Cost-Benefit, we continue with the Couvert ... DO NOT EXPERIENCE THE COUVERT !!! The goat cheese with tomato jam is UNIQUE ... Marinated Salmon in Burrata at the beginning ... Perfect and excellent to share if you are a couple ... We move on to the main dish and TWO FANTASTIC DISHES ... Lasagna. .. FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT LASAGNA !!!! And the Burrata Raviole with Shrimp Ragout ... Difficult to describe !!!! And when we thought it was all over ... THE DESSERT !!!!!! A PISTACHI PUDDING that will make you CRAZY !!!!!!!! I can only say ... GO GO GO TO RISTORANTINO !!!!\n",
      "Very quick, with a good selection of options for lunch.But the main one is even the Chicken Chicken, with half chicken options and the premium chicken.The service was very helpful and quick.\n",
      "Very cool. Super nice atmosphere. Refined dishes. Super cool service. The point is tourist. The beach is not so well attended. But it's worth.\n",
      "Very kind and efficient service without being boring or pedantic.Very tasty food. We went for a cover charge + 2 delicious pasta dishes. The dishes for 2 are well served and really enough for 2 people.Very pleasant atmosphere. There is valet, but we got a spot on Sunday in front of the restaurant. We arrived at 12:20 and we didn't have to wait. When we left there was already a line.There is wine in the glass and wine menu. And the desserts look very good. There was no space left.I recommend it for any type of occasion.\n",
      "well located, service is sometimes time consuming, but it is worth the wait, they serve picanha na pedra (delicious,) mutton meat, baião de dois, sun meat with manioc, among other equally delicious dishes. hummmm!\n",
      "The food served is very good and well served. The menu is huge and the restaurant is big and very beautiful. I thought that the service could improve, especially since the restaurant was not full when I went with my family.\n",
      "We ate a very good feijoada. Worth it. There is a little cigarette smell on the outside tables. Very good draft beer too.\n",
      "The atmosphere is pleasant and well decorated. The food was delicious! Try the sweet and sour shrimp and the Lopana shrimp. The caipirinha is good, but with very little redneck and lots of fruit. The waiters are very slow and pretend not to see the customer calling. The worst thing is to have paid a cover charge and a high price, listening to electronic music.\n",
      "The food is average, but what really pays off is the price and the quantity which is relatively large. Great for saving.\n",
      "The restaurant is tastefully decorated and the atmosphere is very pleasant. The service is very good. We ordered a parmegiana filet that came very tasty and well served. For 3 or 4 people.\n",
      "Top service from waiters Fernando and TiagoMuch kindness and cordiality.I recommend it to anyone interested in good food, pleasant surroundings and a fair price.\n",
      "There is no table to sit on, no variety in the flavors of the pizza, but it is absolutely delicious. It is worth visiting there for a quick snack.\n",
      "Everything perfect, great food, good service, tasteful decor, eat seafood feijoada is excellent.\n",
      "I have been attending this unit for years, and I noticed that in a while now, the quality and structure of the place have fallen. The place is dirty, old decor, the meat doesn't come with the skillet anymore, and the attendant takes a long time to arrive at the table.\n",
      "We arrived, sat down and ate ... a lot ...The carvery costs R $ 54.90 per person and includes several options of shrimp (the one in the strawberry is a must-see) shrimp pastry, shrimp risoles, cod dumpling, shrimp risotto, garlic and oil shrimp ... finally, I felt at Bubba Gump's boat ...The 600ml Bohemia beer costs R $ 9.90.The service was great, but it was a Tuesday night so it was quiet and the waiter only shared our table with two others.It was too worth it ... I hope to return one day.\n",
      "I was at the Grill Mix at the weekend, super cold beers, the snacks were always delicious, I ordered the breaded shrimp dish with Greek rice, just wonderful, worth it. The waiters are really a thousand note.\n",
      "The restaurant is in an area of ​​the army, it is possible to enjoy a good dinner or lunch, viewing the beautiful landscape in front of Praia Vermelha.\n",
      "Great pizza options at all times, the pizza palm trees is the flagship, huge piece with dough on the edges. I always go, a good surprise was the portions of counter file and chicken, well done with the tender and well served meat, from 24 hours a week.\n",
      "The place has great options for healthy meals and in winter they serve varied broths. The salads are great and have a wide variety of juices.\n",
      "Great location, cozy good food, good service and fair price, parking next door, on the street, but with people taking care! Recommended!\n",
      "We went to the new house, excellent service, super well trained employees and waiters who attended and told the story of the house was the employee André, congratulations and I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Expensive food, but not so good, apart from the terrible service. The waiter did not know how to make good food and drink directions, and, in the end, he tried to pass the leg by increasing the value of the drink on the invoice and making larger charges when each one paid.\n",
      "The atmosphere is very pleasant and the food, typical of Minas Gerais, is delicious and plentiful. The ribs with tropeiro beans were delicious. The only detail is that the crackling portion was a little salty.\n",
      "The place and the decor are enchanting, but justifying the pizza prices I still haven't found the why! They are very salty ...\n",
      "Well located in Lagoa da Jansen. The atmosphere is pleasant and very good to enjoy with friends. The beer was already very good a long time ago, but it went downhill. Today the beer is reasonable. I believe that what calls the attention of the place is the party atmosphere with friends and happy hour. There is usually some lively band performing at the venue and engaging the audience with classics from the sertanejo, pagode, axé, etc. I strongly recommend eating snacks that have meat. They are all excellent. It is worth knowing the place.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant and as its name says, specializing in pasta. Buffet by the pound of antipasti with very high quality products such as foie-gras and monstrous prawns in size and more than fair prices. Customer service ten. The snags are the diminutive size of the establishment and long-neck and craft beers just salty the bill.\n",
      "Healthy restaurant option in Brasília. Various salad and grill options. Good location but on the court with few options for places for lunch. Also good price. There could be some innovations in the menu, since it is very standard for a healthy restaurant. Good for a relaxed lunch with a focus on health.\n",
      "Bonne cuisine Et Bon service! Excellent rapport qualité - prix! Good food, good service, so rare in Recife! Excellent wine list\n",
      "Rice with sausage. ..and the maracaju language in the rechaud ....Wonderful environment ...Attendants dressed in character. .. they are a show apartSuper recommend\n",
      "Great Tacacá, despite the size of the bowl, it's worth it! Also try the cassava dumpling and cachaça with jambú.\n",
      "Very good carvery of pizza and pasta. Attentive staff, very pleasant atmosphere. Great location. I recommend.\n",
      "Very good restaurant with a menu prepared by renowned French chef Érick Jacquin. Even when I was staying at the hotel there was an event that happens annually with the chef for him to redesign the menu, I made the reservation and we had dinner there, he was very friendly at all tables to greet and take pictures with the customers.\n"

      "You who appreciate Italian food, like to eat well, be sure to go to the Italian canteen !! Simply delicious! Playful and cozy atmosphere! Delicious and fresh dishes !! A real Italian canteen !! Be sure to know !! You won't regret it !! 👏👏👏👏\n",
      "Delicious food with fair price, offers kids space and the night also works as a bar, I recommend.\n",
      "The pizzas are good and well filled, however the service leaves something to be desired. On the day we were missing 3 waiters and the cook. So imagine what a mess it was. We were going to ask for rotation, but the owner gave us information that would be difficult to answer.The price of the drinks is good.Finally, the service is amateur and needs to improve, as well as the briquedoteca. The bouncing bounce is half broken and can hurt some child.\n",
      "Normal restaurant, waiters are attentive in service.Seat is not available for a larger group.\n",
      "Nice atmosphere and great food! Try the spaghetti parmeggiana made in the middle of a Parmesan cheese. Amazing!\n",
      "A very pleasant bar, it manages to attract people of various age groups. It has a vast menu and prices are very low. I really liked it !\n",
      "Excellent food, very good service, worth checking out, especially after strolling through the Largo da Ordem fair on Sunday. I indicate.\n",
      "I loved staying at Crocobeach, there is everything, even a SPA by the sea! Beautiful place to take photos and take memories of Fortaleza!\n",
      "Beautiful and cozy environment. Attentive and funny attendants, wonderful food, generous portions and fair price.Perfect experience!\n",
      "Note 10 food, mainly the paçoca de carne de sol, made in the pestle, accompanied by a delicious fair macaxeira, green beans and rice with milk and cheese, have no equal. Super nice atmosphere and service. Recomenfo.\n",
      "I like the food and the outback teas, but they always insist on leaving the service in the background. They charge tips but do not serve well.\n",
      "A very high quality service, especially from Waiters Daniel, Gilvan and Antonio, provided us with a unique service improving the experience even more. With excellent cuts the house made my family and I have an incredible experience.\n",
      "In the last 6 months I have had it twice. One for dinner and one for lunch. Summer lunch there can be a little tricky. But cold, well-served craft beer can soothe the room temperature. Rich menu, many Brazilian products. Excelent reception. Location complicated to reach but it is precisely one of the strong points of the place. The drinks menu created by the restaurant is also interesting.\n",
      "Every time I come to Recife Anjo Solto is a must! The crepes are wonderful, inside the gourmets the gratins are crunchy with very special fillings! The place has an alternative climate, ambient music with indoor and outdoor space, great for a beer! Unmissable!\n",
      "The location is certainly a strong point of this restaurant that surprised me positively. Very pleasant environment and responsive service with attentive and polite waiters.On the menu there are good options for meat, poultry, pasta, seafood, salads.We ordered the picanha and it was wonderful, with ideal seasoning and texture.Certainly a good option to get to know.In my experience I recommend it.\n",
      "Restaurant more than 5 stars! Friendliness of the owners Maristela and Neto, exceptional typical dishes, super cozy atmosphere.Be sure to honor the Warehouse on your visit to São Luís, you cannot be disappointed!Enjoy the drinks a unique look that accompanies the dishes! 😋\n",
      "My daughter insisted that we go because she loved it. Honestly, I thought it was over-priced for what we ate. We ordered a burger of the simplest, which came with a portion of potatoes. The bread was tasty, but the filling was nothing special. The potatoes were nothing different from those made at home, they were almost intact. I spent 97 reais for snacks. Honestly, it's not worth it. The cost of renting the restaurant should have a big impact on the final value of the products, as you can eat much better for much less in other simpler places. That's it.\n",
      "We ate a roasted pacu that was wonderful. We were in four and ordered one that cost R $ 145.00. Very good, the quantity was sufficient, but the ideal would be for three. What sinned in the restaurant was the service because there were only two people to take care of everything. It could also have more variety of beers. We asked for an alligator bait at the entrance, but it is very weak.\n",
      "Wonderful food, I ate a risotto with incredible price !!!!! In addition to the entrance very good pastries and indescribable serve caipirinha !!!!! I recommend!!!!\n",
      "Very good, perfect service, very well trained staff, nothing to be desired, I could only add more sauce to meals\n",

      "Wonderful food, super attentive and kind staff, welcoming place! Excellent Italian restaurant!\n",
      "A gastronomic reference of Manaus, which lives up to its growing reputation. I really enjoyed the food, the service and the atmosphere. Eating at Banzeiro is, in fact, making a formidable foray into Amazonian cuisine, expressed in tasty, delicate dishes, prepared and served with remarkable care. Top ten, with praise!\n",
      "Spectacular gastronomy, top quality music, pleasant atmosphere.Mandatory stop for those visiting Natal!\n",
      "The food is good and the portions are huge, however the menus are basic, we won't go there if you've been out of the way.\n",
      "We ate a fillet of wine and a Brie salad, both very delicious. Super beautiful environment and good service.\n",
      "Delicate sandwiches, smaller in size, which allows you to try at least two or more. They were very tasty, really neat. The fast and very kind service, the pleasant atmosphere, cold drink and very good prices.\n",
      "The place is good, for those who like diversification of food, there is everything, barbecue, sushi, french fries, ice cream, gelatin. I ordered a small soba and it was good, despite the broth being a bit tasteless, the sushi is good, but unfortunately the main ingredient was not right, the rice was not well seasoned and something was noticed by both me and my parents, the rice looked like it was mixed with sushi rice with normal rice ... a pity, because the sushi could be much better and please the customers' palate .... The service was excellent, I can't complain, the every moment we were served the most varied types of sushi. And finally I believe that the price would be more worth it if they used better quality rice in the preparation.\n",
      "New bakery in this location, much better than the previous one at the same address. I went with my wife and the service was very good. I made a chosen snack off the menu and the attendant did everything as I requested and my wife chose a hot broth out of the four options available on the day. In the end we bought great and different breads to take. There is a wide range of snacks, snacks and sweets. You can choose tables inside or on the balcony that is covered and glazed.Perfect place for a cappuccino in the late afternoon.\n",
      "For me it is one of the best steakhouses in Natal, the food is very good and very tasty, it has a very good parking space, the atmosphere is very pleasant, spacious and comfortable. Whenever I go to Natal I find a way to go with my wife, very good indeed. And it is well worth the price charged. I recommend !!!\n",
      "The food is good and so is the service.But what is most impressive is the very detailed decoration. Very beautiful!\n"

      "Simple and honest hamburger. However, the size of the sandwich + potatoes and the quality of the condiments unfortunately do not match the price. Would not go back again.\n",
      "Café Viena has many food options and the drinks I love! In general the price is high, but some options are certain. High points are the drinks and the prices are fair. Now ... make sure to order the cheesecake with cappuccino ... the perfect combination! Best cappuccino of my life (I prefer thicker and stronger cappuccino).\n",
      "We were in a group of 8 people on a not too busy Sunday after the beach. The service was very bad, we had to wait a lot and always ask or repeat our orders, even though the restaurant is not full.I ate one of the hamburgers that comes with dried tomato pesto, but I didn't think anything was too much, the taste was bland. The banana chopp was even tasty, it's worth asking to share it with someone, just to kill curiosity.\n",
      "Nice place. Some nights there is a nice sound for the crowd, both in the outside area (backyard) and inside. The shirt shop works normally during the shows and in the afternoon you can see the beautiful sunset.\n",
      "Excellent place to gather family or friends to catch up and still eat sun meat.\n",
      "I visited the house as a birthday guest and the place is spectacular !!!! Top notch service, attentive waiters, first class food and for connoisseurs like my beer friends I only heard compliments.Worth the price paid and still has the special touch of decoration that draws attention. Anyway I recommend the visit to everyone !!!!\n",
      "It was the first visit I made to this esfiharia. The food is fresh, in the case of hummus, served with warm pita bread. I also ate meat and cheese sfiha. They are also hot and tasty. Very friendly and cordial service. I will continue attending to try other items on the menu. I almost certainly will improve the assessment.\n",
      "the super trained and educated staff. always ready to serve you promptly, super clean and well maintained place\n",
      "I returned to this restaurant at the end of a city tour with a small group of Italian tourists. The system is self-service, with dishes displayed on islands. It was difficult to translate certain typical dishes into Italian, such as tidy and the beef jerky (which is dried meat).\n",
      "Good service, good food .. including hot dishes .. good atmosphere and common price in the region.\n",
      "Christmas has a special feature: the more organized the environment the better you eat and the less you pay. So, escape the indefectible beach huts! This steakhouse is no exception. You can enter the carvery (R $ 34 / person) or order an a la carte dish (between R $ 60 and R $ 100) in which 4 people eat peacefully with great quality.\n",
      "I met Aconchego Carioca when I was still a dirty bar in the same street. The food was good and the price was fair.It became famous and moved (to a house across the street, with more space and air conditioning), but I was disappointed in this new visit after a few years.The waiter's service was below criticism. I don't know if they no longer care about customers being well served, because the fame he created must attract people (who was having lunch there on the same day was ClaudeTroisgros, at a table with several people).To start, we ordered a portion of the famous feijoada dumpling (the price of which is very high - R $ 25.00 for a portion with 4 dumplings) and as a main dish a baião de dois. The portion of dumplings took about 15 minutes to arrive, but the main course took almost 50 minutes to be served !!!! Even though I asked the waiter about 3 times if it would take too long and received the same answer: it's already leaving! - without even having gone to check. Then I ordered 2 coffees, the leftover in a warm one and the bill. He simply forgot about the coffee and, after 10 minutes I asked again and he said Ah! The coffee ... and served us the coffee and handed us our warm to the other table (we had to say it was ours). The bill, of course, nothing. And he came and went everywhere without asking to close our account. My wife got up and went to the cashier, that's when he said: the bill !!! and the cashier closed the account in less than 5 seconds (it was only the individual who asked to close it). We paid (of course, without the 10%) and, after more than an hour and a half, we managed to get out of there, having eaten reasonably well, but with terrible service and expensive prices.The food was good, but not at a level that we could classify as exceptional or unmissable ... The owner was there, but she was more concerned with paying attention to Claude and his friends than seeing how the regular customers (who paid for the food) ) were being served.Disappointing.\n",
      "As good onlookers I could not leave this restaurant out of our tours. Incredible, cozy atmosphere, in the right size to serve the customer well and with quality. The menu is very varied, nothing obvious, the dishes are beautiful, and very well prepared, without a doubt the BEST pork we've ever eaten !!! The service is done with a lot of sympathy, we were pleasantly surprised to find Chef Jefferson Rueda's wife, who was at the door of the restaurant welcoming customers with unparalleled sympathy. We did not expect almost anything for the meals, they were quick .... The price is close to so much good food, worth a lot !!! Next time I will try the fast restaurant, a window facing the street serves practical foods, snacks, small portions ... We will be back !!!\n",
      "Nice food. fair price, stylish ambience, friendly waiters, clean bathroom, wonderful view, well worth a visit.\n",
      "A place with wines at honest prices and a thousand delicious tapas. Service 10 !!! Efficient and knew everything. Nice food. all the best!\n",
      "traditional steakhouse in BH, has a branch in pampulha, serves in the rodizio system with affordable price and good salad buffet. small hall always very busy and has a good variety of meats.\n",
      "Expensive dishes without refinement. I wouldn't say it's bad, but I found it disappointing. The mango caipirosca with passion fruit was very good. House tip.\n",
      "Imagine that you left home looking for a place to eat ... by chance, you ended up in a narrow street and came across a curious restaurant.Well, we stopped at this scene hoping it was nothing special ... and it was not that it was surprising!The atmosphere is cozy, the food is very good, the decor (with old movie posters, album covers ...) fantastic and the service is very peculiar!I liked it so much that I go back there whenever I can. The portions are generous, the seasoning is neat and the price is right!Try it!\n",
      "Note 10. Impeccable. Without a doubt, the best shrimp in Maceió. Well served and tasty. Fair price. Don't let go. Look for Gil's service.\n",
      "Buffet by weight, from the Pomme Dor chain. Always great. Delicious food, good atmosphere, good service, fair price.\n",

      "We ate the international Camarao, the dish is very well served many Cameroon super tasty. Modern and cozy atmosphere\n",
      "It met my expectations ... we ordered 2 dishes and an entrance for 7 adults, we ate, and a lot, and there was still a lot left ....... and it's not good just for the quantity, the quality of the dishes is fantastic, with a excellent value for money, a pity there is no area for the little ones to be distracted ......\n",
      "Traditional Asian food. The location and atmosphere are good. Comfortable chairs and tables. The menu is not very varied, but it has good options.You can improve in the preparation for food to arrive still hot at the table. Some dishes are not freshly made, such as the side dishes of the executive dish.Lunch menu (executive) with starter, dish and accompaniment costs R $ 47 during the week.\n"

      "I don't know what happened to Rock Burguer, it had everything to be good. The quality dropped a lot from time to ca. Yesterday I went, it was horrible, the meat was cold, the potato wilted, the cheese looked like it was reheated, the air conditioner was hitting the tables, causing some discomfort. Neither me nor my friend liked it. I will hardly come back.\n",
      "My main tip for anyone who attends any restaurant of the Outback chain is to go during the week and arrive early to avoid the queues and enjoy the Happy Hour with all the drinks for half the price! Caipirinhas are my favorites, especially the Red Passion. There are also some special dishes only at this time like one that comes with ribs, french fries and the famous chicken wings (order the light sauce!). Only the outback onion was missing (laughs).\n",
      "The place is extremely pleasant, great service and perfect food. Refinement for any occasion.\n",
      "The restaurant has a cozy decor, refers to an Arab but it is not, the food is contemporary and delicious and the values ​​are as expected, the dishes are well served, I left there satisfied! I was referred by a friend and I can say that they won a client.\n",

      "A wonderful place with delicious food, a pleasant atmosphere and wonderful service I was attended by the very attentive waiter Souza is to be congratulated note 10 !!\n",
      "I visit the restaurant frequently, because in the region it is what manages to add good price, variety, good service and speed. A differentiator is that you can choose to rotate with dessert and drink (juice, tea and soda). The atmosphere is pleasant and calm, in times of capacity the service could take, but I noticed that this does not happen anymore, at least in my last visits, even with capacity, everything that was asked came very fast. Food quality is good, they do not serve cold food. It does not have Wi-Fi for customers and neither TV, I believe that these could be another differential and even an attraction on dates with events broadcast on TV!\n",
      "Despite all the publicity that this small establishment has received, it is only a reasonable restaurant. The prices are good, honest for the food it offers. At the beginning, I ate a coxinha that loses to the fattest bakery: it just doesn't have chicken, it barely tastes like it. The feijoada, although a little greasy, was tasty, and the dessert, an ice cream nest that became a hit on social media, is a grandmother's dessert, the sweetest. In general, a good place to have lunch on a daily basis, although there are better ones in the region with the same proposal.\n",
      "I have already attended a few times, excellent service, cozy atmosphere. Wonderful cerviche and varied menu. My choice is a dish that uses mashed plantain that is amazing to combine with fish.\n",
      "The best traditional esfiha in town, I recommend, in the past there was only the counter, now there are tables to taste.\n",

      "Good for health, you can have tasty and healthy things and many people don't know it and you can still keep in shape\n",
      "As it was very crowded, it took us a long time to find available tables and the service left a little to be desired. With regard to breakfast, it also left a little to be desired. The coffee came cold and the lack of flexibility of the attendants also disappointed us. The atmosphere is very beautiful, but I do not recommend it for breakfast on a weekend.\n",
      "I love the chicken steak, but the salad is a little poor. The service is always good and fast. Mate is a good drink choice\n",
      "Restaurant specializing in Portuguese cuisine but also serves excellent capixaba moqueca. Highlights for open fire cod and kid. Restaurant without risk of making mistakes, super professional. Kind and attentive service. Good wine list and excellent for business meetings.\n",
      "We recommend Braseiro, a great quality burger, menu with good options, pleasant atmosphere, very good service !!\n",
      "I had already visited similar restaurants in Rio de Janeiro, but this one was special! Very pleasant atmosphere with beautiful decor (I love emporiums!) And very polite and friendly staff! My boyfriend and I had not made a reservation (which was necessary because it was Valentine's Day) but we were very well attended and allocated at a table, waiting less than 10 minutes! Very tasty meat, at the point I requested! Accompanied by canoe potato (sequinha) and a delicious farofa !! Highlight for the chimichurri that was perfect !! The menu is very varied, with many options for cuts! The price is right for the quality and quantity of the portions! My experience at La Macellaria was a top 10 !!\n",
      "Typical tapas bar with an Italian twist.Above average service, good variety of wines without having to leave your pants, starters and dishes well served and prepared, great atmosphere to go with friends or flirt.They have discounts for those who are going to buy wine, cold cuts and cheese for the trip.Menu with a huge variety of delicious things, I will certainly be back.I recommend.\n",
      "The restaurant Sabor a Mil is very old in Porto Velho and well known, has an excellent fish menu.\n",

      "The place is like an emporium that sells everything imported: cod, olive oil, beers, wine! And also a food restaurant, which goes from the regional pirarucú, from the northeastern carne de sol, and the Portuguese with cod! Imported beers with great variety and several Brazilian brands! Ask for the huge delay in service and arrival of the dishes! Worth the food! Reasonable price\n",
      "Great restaurant, pleasant atmosphere, fast service and delicious carvery, not to mention the cold beer that is suuuuupeeer. Recommend 👍\n",
      "Great atmosphere next to the shopping center. Tasty snacks and ice cream. Meeting point. Fast service. Very good.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant, simple food with revised recipes, beautiful place, with excellent drinks. Fair prices\n",
      "I loved the place. Cheerful atmosphere, great drinks and to close it has a wide variety of shows. We went on Wednesday at the Arlindinho pagoda. What a wonderful sound. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Typically Portuguese restaurant. The owner is of Portuguese origin and very demanding with his own dishes. The decoration also reminds us a lot of Portuguese houses, making you always get in the mood for the meal with a background music from the country. Bacalhau à Abadia is certainly my favorite, but à Narcisa is not far behind. These are the two dishes that cok sure have no mistake. The price is not the cheapest, but they serve 2 people very well and the quality is supreme. I Think it's really worth it.\n",
      "On the last visit I did not leave with a good impression, I found the cleaning lacking, bad food. I do not recommend.\n",
      "a great place to have a beer and listen to good music.special service. with waiter with waiter's call requestat the table just press the button and everything is resolved or need to be calling the waiterlike crazy like in some beer bars.\n",
      "Delicious evening! Vegan and vegetarian menu, with great flavor to the carvery! Excellent service, especially the waiter Lucas!\n",
      "I love the juices and vitamins they serve and the relaxed atmosphere they have. Whenever I pass by or when I'm around I take a break to go there and relax and have some juice. Which, by the way, leaves very quickly. I don't usually eat anything, so I can't talk about sandwiches or snacks. Ah, I once had a smoothie with ice cream but it wasn't worth it, I think it's important to say: 3\n",
      "Unlike most reviews here, my experience was during a lunch hour, on a weekday. The place is super cool, cool, with a varied menu and very tasty food! The house soda / tea options were also great, everything was delicious! The only point is that the service, although friendly, was quite slow (and the house wasn't even full!) Anyway, I'll be back and recommend it!\n"

      "New and trendy restaurant in town. Pleasant atmosphere, menu with good options for all tastes. For lunch it is advisable to make a reservation. Worth the visit!\n",
      "Located in a half deserted street, on a street perpendicular to the waterfront. I ate stew, the size was not enough for two people and the price was expensive for the size of the dish. It tasted good and the service was pleasant.\n",
      "After nine days in Brazil, we got sick of traditional beef served with rice and bad fries. We chose to go to La Fondue and were very happy that we did. Our meal consisted of three fondues, a meat, cheese and chocolate. They served us a nice salad first with some chips and some garlic spaghetti which was tasty. The grilled meat and chicken on our table that served us with 12 different sauces. At the same time we were served a delicious cheese fondue that tasted like Swiss cheese with pieces of bread. It was no longer enough to feed, in fact we went to this point quite complete, but don't miss the chocolate fondue. It was hot and very delicious and served with many wonderful fruits. They even gave us another plate of bananas and strawberries. A good dining experience. The staff was very attentive.\n",
      "I went to the site for Trip reviews, but I was disappointed ...The carvery option is simply not worth it ... The waiters take a long time to come to the table, only 05 types of dishes with Shrimps are offered and all taste very artificial ...The rotation leaves R $ 69,90The environment is very beautiful and organized, but I do not recommend the rotation.Maybe the La Carte dishes might be worth it, as I saw several people in the restaurant choosing this option.- Strength: Environment- Weak point: Rodizio too weak (there are several options on the menu, but they offered only 05 options)- Price: R $ 200,00 carvery + 01 pitcher of juice\n",
      "The restaurant has beautiful decor and a refined atmosphere. Prices are expensive, but the meal is simply unforgettable! The best food I have tasted in the city. On the day we went, we faced a small queue and, after ordering, we waited a long time for it to arrive at the table.\n",
      "It was worth it despite a half-hour wait, the reception is welcoming because during the wait we were offered a portion of smoked fries and coca cola, after we went to a table where the order comes out quickly, and the delicious tender meat, also for starters a very different and very tasty honey-based bread was served, the onion that looks like a flower a delight, comfortable atmosphere, nice service, note: the desserts are divine.\n",
      "It has the best ribs, in my opinion. It is well served and excellent. The atmosphere is pleasant, but the great tip is to arrive early at the place because the waiting line is always long if you arrive at mealtimes, especially at night.\n",
      "We had dinner at the restaurant and had to go back. A little expensive ... but good food and excellent dessert! We recommend!\n",
      "I went with my daughter, it's close to where I live and we heard well ...We sat outside with a pleasant breeze, we ate the chef's starter and a dish of shrimp and pasta called Honulua, all delicious, with flavored water. Good service and good food!\n",
      "I loved having lunch looking at the sea, the environment and pleasant. The seasoning seemed very carioca, a well seasoned black bean I felt at home. I recommend it all the time\n",
      "Installed in a colonial style house, it offers a nostalgic atmosphere, with good ambient music. Easy and secure parking, in the home gardens. A la carte services are perfect. The specialty of the house could not fail to be, are the dishes based on cod, accompanied by a good Portuguese wine. The prices practiced are consistent with what is offered, considering the quality of the cod, the way of preparation and the promptness of service. Worth knowing.\n",
      "I went with my wife to the Mercatto do Flamboyant and ordered the filet à parmegiana. The dish, which costs 88.00 reais + 10%, came with a strange taste. The same taste of food when you forget about it in your home oven for a while. To make matters worse it still came cold. We asked the waiter to warm up and after 25 min he brought the dish again. I complained about the dish and he pretended it wasn't with him.I do not indicate or return more.\n",
      "Delicious food and the atmosphere is good but the service is poor. The waiter who performed the service was very bad no. Due to the service I intend not to return to the place. Between pizza, dessert and drink we paid 178 reais we were in 05 people.\n",
      "The buffet has many options, but nothing is tasty. The decor is modern, the service is reasonable and the price is good, if you buy a coupon on collective shopping sites.\n",
      "The food is just wonderful. The variety of lobsters and side dishes is surprising. The service is very good, the carvery is delicious. It perfectly suits even the most demanding palates.\n",
      "Great option to dine in Copacabana, delicious dishes, the menu says it serves up to 2 people, but serves 3 quietly. The super attentive owner, excellent service. Fair value.\n",
      "Full restaurant! Congratulations on serving the waiters, especially for Alison's promptness and warmth!\n",
      "It is the restaurant inside the ceasa. I liked the food there. The price is the main attraction. I recommend and will return more often.\n",
      "The place is beautiful. But I have no idea what the sandwich tastes like, first because they are expensive and second because I wasn’t very hungry. In this vibe I decided to get potatoes, not least because they are fast. I didn't have a legal service, they forgot the order and everyone at the table had eaten. I paid dearly and ate something that certainly could have been done better. You go once a month and that's it. LOL\n",
      "We went last Sunday with a group of friends. The service is good and the people are friendly. The place makes us feel at home, even because the restaurant is in a house and has this purpose. When arriving at the place the view really impresses, because it is not imagined that it would have such a beautiful and open view to a valley. With regard to food, the cost-benefit left something to be desired (and a lot)! I ordered a sea bass muqueca ... little fish and a lot, but a lot of broth, with a lot of tomatoes. The snacks were good (fish and chips), however, the price is very high, compared to high-end restaurants in Brasilia. In short, I would not return for waiting more than one muqueca and for the very high price charged.\n",
      "We celebrated the company fraternization at the steakhouse, the service was perfect. The price is low for a good meal, pleasant and comfortable environment.\n",
      "From the service to the facilities, everything is wonderful. Very hygienic, always warm and delicious food. I've been visiting for years and I never regret it. Super, super recommended, wonderful.\n",
      "I found it incredible in Ponta Negra to have a place with affordable prices. You go to the beach and enjoy a well-prepared dish at a fair price that doesn't hurt your pocket. Very recommended!\n",
      "Well frequented bar, with an 80's style feel, with good music, cold drink and good snacks. Helpful staff. Queue after 20:00. Just know! Liked it!!!\n",
      "I really liked the El Turko Kebaberia-Bar.The service and the cost x benefit were very good. I recommend.\n",
      "I've been looking for a good pizza in Brasilia for some time and, after some frustrations, I finally found a pizzeria that deserves a vote of confidence. I met Bene Gusto by referral, I decided to test by making a delivery order and I did not regret it. The pizza is very well filled and tasty, it arrived at the agreed delivery time (35 minutes), hot and well made. The price is on average in Brasilia. To win the 10, the dough could be a little drier, but that did not stop it from being classified as one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten in Brasília.\n",
      "Very good, good location. Delicious mushrooms. Good tuna. They bring everything quickly. I didn't really like the handlebars or the spring rolls.\n",
      "Restaurant inside the mall. I have visited it several times and in the past I confess it was better. Even so, at the prices it practices, it is still one of the best options within the city's shopping centers.\n",
      "The king of mate is a house of juices, snacks, etc. Delicious natural and whole grain savory and sandwiches are offered. Diversified and very fresh juices are found. The house mates are excellent and quality. It is a great choice for an afternoon snack or even breakfast.\n"

      "I already knew the chain in Maceió, but in Aracaju everything seemed even better both for the food and the place. The location is not very close to the waterfront, but as the city is small everything is easy to get to. Honestly with so many options of fish dishes I have never tried pizza.\n",
      "Bad pizza, atmosphere is not the most pleasant. has pasta, pizza, and snacks at a good price, but the quality of the food matches the reality of the price\n",
      "Place with excellent service. We joined the Festival of the house. Very good. You have nothing to complain about. Just a small note, about the value of the festival that is not on the menu. Other than that, everything was perfect.\n",

      "We love the restaurant. The atmosphere, the food, the drinks ... everything was tasty and special, in a cozy and charming atmosphere.\n",
      "We were 12 people and got a seat easily despite the holiday eve. Very good service, reasonable prices, as well as the decor.Good cost benefit.\n",
      "The service is kind of unsympathetic, done by cute but unprepared people. A model comes to serve you and you don't understand anything he says. Ask a question off the menu and there is no answer. The attitude of the security guards then is not talked about ... So, the environment remains. Settled, busy and funky. The food is not such wonders. Normal card'apio, I found with few options. Basic, but good! Worth the fun.\n",
      "I went to lunch this Saturday, we chose kilo. I didn't see anything different about the dishes. Common food in my opinion. The grills are good, but not of a higher level. I will hardly come back.I didn't taste Japanese.\n",
      "A great restaurant for a good meal and I recommend the Carne de Sol with rennet cheese that comes with accompanying fried cassava, tropeiro beans, rice and a vinaigrette and costs on average 35 reais excluding desserts with typical ingredients and all with the signature of chef Wandeson Mendeiros. It is very worthwhile for an individual lunch, with friends, on business and a dinner with your wife or girlfriend.\n",
      "Steakhouse with few meat options and long service. In order to eat picanha, the national preference, I had to ask the manager. The quality of the food in general was below expectations for a steakhouse.\n",

      "With perfect service, to taste a typical chicken with accompaniment of wonderful pasta to choose the sauce.\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, with live chorinho on Wednesdays.All the attendants are very friendly. The house is small and the tables are on the sidewalk of a nice quiet street.Very exclusive and delicious starters.I found the croquettes, although tasty, very greasy from frying.Great for snacking, having good drinks at the right priceWorth going again\n",
      "The place is well located and correct. The menu features a handful of options for sophisticated burger recipes and yet another guest recipe, all with top quality ingredients. It is worth it for those who like the proposal.\n",
      "I was at the Banzeiro restaurant with a very large group of people (including Brazilian and foreign visitors), for dinner. The expectation was great, considering that the place is considered the best restaurant in Manaus. However, my experience was frustrating. As it was a dinner linked to an event, there was a closed menu, with starters, main course and dessert. Despite this (which should - in theory - bring more agility and efficiency to the service), the dishes took a long time to arrive and some had serious problems - who asked for the meat option saw some steaks so sturdy that many had to be replaced , further delaying the meal. I opted for a pirarucu with shimeji and mashed manioc and black rice - but the dish didn't tell me much: it was just correct (and not the delight I expected) and the mash was not manioc, but baroa (the which would not be a problem in itself, but which came to add to all the other messes). The desserts followed at the same pace, taking a long time to be served, which caused discomfort - and they came without cutlery, which meant that one had to wait a little longer to start the tasting. My choice (Tropical Pineapple) was just a handful of slices of the fruit with ice cubes - the description said to bring currant blades, but it did not correspond to reality. The taperebá ice cream also did not please those who tried it. The waiters were quite confused, showing a certain unpreparedness to serve a large group. With so much disagreement and disenchantment, the maître d 'could have done some kindness, like offering a coffee without extra charge, for example. But no: the lack of promptness continued at the end and the maitre d 'still acted surprised when my husband and I refused to pay the 10% service fee. Moral of the story: I considered my experience at Banzeiro to be a very frustrating and unpleasant episode and it was clear that they do not have the capacity to serve large groups.\n",
      "Good place to take friends and family, has a child seat, wonderful service, delicious food, live music, equipped security.\n",
      "the sushi here is great and the temaki is one of the best in town too, the service is very good, it’s worth coming here to eat\n",
      "at the brothers' bar there is one of the best bushes in the resort, I recommend everyone open from Tuesday to Sunday from 11 am until the last customer leaves.\n",
      "The food is very good. It may even be the best French restaurant in Curitiba. Prices are excellent, very fair for a very high standard dinner.I think that for such a sophisticated restaurant, changing the menus, which are a bit worn out by use, would be cool.The downside is that the restaurant only has a poorly positioned air conditioner, so if people at the table next to the air conditioner ask to turn it off, the restaurant turns into an oven. Unfortunately, it happened at my dinner, which made it very uncomfortable.\n",
      "Restaurant with cozy atmosphere. Extremely tasty food. Choice of dishes for 1 or 2 people. My suggestion is for the cod with the cream sauce. A delight!\n",
      "Excellent service, full menu, is a good place to eat, good price. clean place, a good barbecue is offered there. It is worth visiting.\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, good service. Açai delights, as well as the dishes ... another one has a diaper and toys.\n",
      "Typical Argentine food with excellent cuts of meat. Environment with decoration that recalls the culture of the brothers and good service. The dulce de leche pancake and the churros are excellent. Great cost benefit!\n",
      "It is a very pleasant regional environment and serves a wonderful peacock bass, the roasted or fried fish has an incomparable flavor, I ate at other places and Cabana do Lago is the best without a doubt. Worth a try.\n",
      "The place is excellent, I liked everything, from the service, the beauty of the place and the cost benefit. The tours offered are of the highest quality. The way of approaching the professionals when offering services is something impressive, the tourist does not feel coerced to buy the packages as occurs in other cities.\n",
      "great service, easy location, first class food, delicious and for various tastes, being able to book a table for: family, business, romantic, I went several times and I was always well received and served.\n",

      "Good atmosphere! I have come a few times and have always been very well attended! Fair price! Delicious food! The wine list has a great price too!\n",
      "Restaurant focused on Brazilian cuisine and excellent preparation. All the dishes ordered were delicious and everyone at the table praised them. The restaurant is on a small and slightly hidden street, but the decor is cute and the service is perfect. It's quite expensive, but it's worth it. Be sure to take the candy offered at the exit.\n",
      "Wonderful food. Excelent reception. Pleasant environment. Easy parking. Friendliness and joy throughout the place.I recommend the vegetarian muqueca.\n",
      "I went as a great expectation to get to know Holy Burguer, and I don't know if I liked the experience I had. I ordered the traditional Holy Burger with side fries and a coke. The service was good and my sandwich was not long in coming. But I thought the hamburger itself was no big deal and I didn't like the flavor of the mayonnaise. I even asked if my sandwich had been made with industrialized mayonnaise. Well, other than that the place is very small but very beautiful and well decorated. The only bad thing is to smell like hamburger all over your clothes. I want to give the place another chance soon! ;)\n"

Greek beer, spectacular!For those who do not know Greek cuisine, it goes very well, but if they want to reach the public that really knows and likes Greek dishes, they need to improve!\n",

      "I went to this restaurant twice, the first time we chose the shrimp carvery and it was really good, we really liked the variety and flavor, the second time we chose the a la carte and we were frustrated, because the portion was small and the fish was very hard.\n",
      "The place is great, very beautiful, beautiful people, good music and cold beer! However, the indoor environment is very noisy, due to the band. The external environment seems to be pleasant, but it also does not seem to be part of the restaurant.The internal environment is entirely closed with glass and the space has air conditioning that meets the demand well. The waiters don't give you much thought, I don't know if it was pre-trial, or if they are insufficient, they took time to answer, but when they did they were helpful. The day I went, it was full of groups of friends. The beer is cold, but it is a little expensive. Overall it is a good place to visit, but it is not a good time to stay. I left right away.\n",
      "We discovered the restaurant on the 4th day that we were in town. I saw the food is wonderful at the right price with generous portions. It has regional food and good old fries and pasta.

The food is delicious, yes, but I think the restaurant sins in the presentation of the dishes. Although the menu looked like a very gourmet line, the presentation was very poor. Missing the touch of a cheff.\n",
      "Nothing incredible but on average it is good, good variety of oriental dishes, good quality, good service, clean environment\n",
      "Nice atmosphere, very tasty food and one of the best prices in SP. Nowadays it is rare to eat a good pasta for 30 reais! The dishes are not very big, but they are satisfying when accompanied by a starter (the cover charge for 5 reais per person is a good one!).\n",
      "Wonderful atmosphere and the food is not even talked about! We ordered a dry meat dumpling with curd and pepper jelly that was divine. We shared a saffron rice dish with octopus which was wonderful! I loved the place, the service, the price and the food. I will be back several times!\n",
      "I went in the afternoon, ordered a special strained coffee, a cheese bread and a piece of iced coconut cake, it was incredible, the coffee I had to repeat was too good, the cheese bread is outstanding, I took the last ones away, and the cake was delicious, everything was very well prepared and well served, with lots of Brazilianness, well-selected ingredients, and very polite, friendly people willing to offer a fantastic experience.\n",

      "Wonderful food and an even better chat place .... Belém has long lacked a space like this, which was available to visitors at various times ... It is safe, it is located within the main shopping centers in Belém. a varied menu, ranging from pizza to a delicious steak. The prices are great and the service is very good ..\n",
      "I ate a stuffed pastry that was delicious. I just found the dish with little food, which led me to order dessert, which by the way was very good !!! There is only an alert about the bill, we charged drinks that we did not consume. When questioning, the mistake was corrected ...\n",
      "This is a Japanese restaurant that appeals to everyone. Chef Marcelo San really is a show.Japanese fusion cuisine is made with so much affection that it is noticeable in each dish ordered. From sashimi to robata.Sauces are always an explosion of flavors.The atmosphere is excellent, an incredible internal architecture.Real professional service.\n",
      "In my opinion, one of the most comfortable restaurants in the Tatuapé region. This of course, following oriental food.I had a great experience.\n",
      "I ordered a filet with dijon mustard sauce and it was delicious. I ordered the meat rare and it actually came in the right spot. The palm heart and chestnut risotto was divine. My friend ordered a salmon with red fruit sauce and brie cheese and loved it. Although it came raw inside, they took it to roast more and brought it quickly to the right spot. Although the fame of the food took a while, it came out relatively quickly.\n",
      "The service is very bad, there is no pizza, we stayed more than 1 hour and 4 or 5 pizza options were offered. What saved him was the island of pasta and dessert from the buffet.\n",
      "Nice place to have lunch duringWeek! Fixed price of 29.90.localClean and organized. Impreco includes dessert\n",
      "I recommend the nightclub that runs from 11pm. Brazilian music, beautiful people and a very lively atmosphere! But get ready to touch your pocket !!! admission costs R $ 35 on weekends and drinks and drinks are not cheap at all.\n",
      "It was a closed lunch event. They prepared a menu with starter, main and dessert, it was amazing!\n",

      "The new room was beautiful with a mix of rustic and classic, the vertical garden brought life to the place. I find this comparison mania between restaurants a bit boring, each place has its differential or seasoning and that's it. The dishes are delicious, the dessert too, first class service and a very pleasant environment.\n",

      "Twice delivery missed my order. Last time, he sent the burnt pizzas (the candy was not enough to eat) and did not send my soda. Graça Di Napolli is not an inexpensive corner pizzeria, it is expensive and expects excellent service. I complained and you know what they did? They deleted my Instagram post from them. They could have sent a new pizza, given a voucher, done something to repair the error ... But no, they deleted the post with the complaint. Here they cannot erase. That's how customers are lost. Lack of quality, good service, transparency, professionalism. I do not recommend. If they are asking for the apps, they are obliged to repair them. To err is not the problem, but not to repair the error is very serious. I threw my money and my night away.\n",
      "Great option to eat on the edge of Praia da Pajuçara. My mom and I ordered a 4-piece pizza, which was delicious. The price is good.\n",
      "I have been to this place a few times with friends, family and my Husband. I always go for the purpose of eating the rib at Bafo which serves 4 people well, so I don't have much to say about the other dishes.But the ribs are wonderful ... the seasoning, the timing and the service is very fast, so if you want to have a cervix first, don't order the dish,The place is simple, the service is good, the market price does not escape much .... and the rib..hmmmmm. I recommend!\n",
      "I ate a lamen tonkotsu spice, it was very tasty and I tried the ramen miso which was also delicious. We ordered a bacon okonomiyaki which was to be desired .... It looked very strange compared to other restaurants ...Despite having the average price in the neighborhood, the bill was a bit salty for charging for tea and 10%, and most restaurants there do not charge.\n",

      "Super nice and refined atmosphere. Attentive and friendly waiters, who always help us choose the dish. Quality Italian food with an extensive choice of pasta with various sauces. The pastas are self-made and very tasty. It is really difficult to choose between the various options. I love the Mediterranean fettuccine. And for dessert be sure to order the famous torte tres leche.\n",
      "Super nice place, attentive and friendly waiters, food always impeccable. It is always worth returning!\n",
      "I've been there several times. I have known this restaurant since the time it was a refuge in a forgotten part of Rio de Janeiro. Delicious food, smelling of the bush, the owner circulating between the tables and talking with the customers ..... good times ..... Now Vargem Grande has grown and the Gepetto has been discovered. The food is still very good, but .... run away from the holidays, LOTA. It's always a mess. In the back they sell pastel and it is a riot. The attendants are bewildered. While waiting, so much pastel is eaten that when you are called by the speaker saying that your table is free, the hunger is gone ...... Go !, be sure to go because it is very good, but on ordinary days. Take a weekend or even during the week. Excellent for children, because it has a playground and pets.\n",

      "Highly renowned restaurant, with 2 renowned chefs, lives up to all fame. Unsophisticated atmosphere, simple but tasteful decor, efficient service. Reserve, as demand is always high. The menu is very different, with a mix of ingredients from different regions of Brazil. We ordered 2 starters: the cashew ceviche (great) and the crunchy mani (a mixture of small portions, all different- wonderful). The main dishes were: the lamb palette (the best I've ever eaten) and my wife ordered the lapsang crusted roast beef (excellent). There is the option of tasting menu but, exaggeratedly expensive (470.00 per person). Very good wine list. Anyway, get ready to spend more than usual, but it's worth it.\n",
      "This is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in the city, it is complete.The starters are divine, the dishes, especially the picanha, are delicious.It has a footprint of Northeastern cuisine, and is located in one of the most beautiful tourist spots in the city the coast\n",
      "Varied menu, not just seafood or fish. Plenty of dishes, two people eat very well, three with moderate appetite are satisfied. Ok service, fair price, no service charge. A bit expensive desserts. I definitely DO NOT recommend the cheesecake, which sucks.\n",
      "Very good !! Delicious food, impeccable service ... Going to Natal, be sure to go to this Bakery .... Go and enjoy yourself !!\n",
      "Worst dish I've ever eaten in Maceió! Pure mozzarella cheese. Only eat if you like cheese very much, but VERY much. I caught the prawns and ate with the rice. The cheese cools, becomes rubbery, tasteless. Horrible! With so much good fish in Maceió, I still can't believe that I paid so much for this crap.But the service is great.\n"

      "Self-service restaurant located in the Natal Shopping food court. The management of the place is the same as that of the Camarões restaurant, which guarantees the quality standard of the dishes that are served here. For those who don't want to face the long lines of Cameroon, Caicoense is a great option, with a very varied menu and delicious food.\n",

The Wals brewery, naturally from Minas Gerais, is served at the tasting point, and in my opinion it is undoubtedly one of the best produced in the country. The portion of curry sausage is delicious! Excellent for celebration, meetings with friends or romantic. I love the decor and the service never disappoint!\n",
      "The place is a classic and authentic Cuiabano restaurant, the portions are well served and the price is right, the service is friendly and very picturesque, it is worth knowing, the fish in general are prepared in the traditional way of the Baixada Cuiabana, that is, delicious . Another dish that is very cool and reminiscent of the past is parmigiana fillet.\n",
      "This is where I feel most comfortable, since sushi is displayed on a table and you help yourself to it. Chinese food is also delicious. Even the juices are perfect.Unlike a competitor, you don't ask and wait half an hour. Here you can get bored in less than 30 minutes! Only bad is the parking lot, which is small and you have to put it on the street, sometimes distant.\n",
      "I like pastries too much. And I don't miss even the bus stations, whose fame everyone knows. I've never had any problems. I went to Viçosa and liked it. The menu is huge and with the most exotic names for the most varied fillings. In it there is the system of casters, but if you don't eat more than 3 you have already entered the loss and look that the pastry is great. It is not easy to eat more than 2. I ate Brasiliense and found it delicious. I recommend\n",

      "For those who like American-style meats (yes, forget that Outback is an Australian restaurant, because it is not), it is always a good choice. But, the value of the portions accompanying the main meal is very high, and the price of beers and soft drinks is also high. Finally, the final price is higher than the restaurant offers, although it is still one of the best restaurant chains in Brazil.\n",

There is a sauce that goes very well with the fish.Modern gastronomy valuing local ingredients. It opens from Monday night !, which is an advantage for those traveling on restricted days.\n",
      "It was the best beach that I sat around Maceió. A beautiful structure, good attendants, live music and very affordable value. The tip is: get there early, leave the house around 7am and take the road. The place has different points to stay, arriving early the chance to get the best place, with sun loungers and hammocks facing the sea, increases. It is VERY worth it.\n",
      "Excellent structure. Special service. I did not give a maximum score, as I did not find it legal to charge 500 reais for using the tent. The tent was empty and so was the beach. But otherwise just compliments.\n",

      "The oysters at the entrance were great, there was no fig in the salad but they suggested mango in the drink with absolut, coconut water lacked fig and they suggested lemon and I accepted. the ravioloni in fonduta was very well done but the chef was wrong to put almost raw chives on the plate and broke the flavor.\n",

      "Excellent food, as it is an authentically Japanese restaurant, do not expect a carvery system. In addition to the tables, you can be served at the sushi counter with the privilege of watching them perform live and in color. I recommend the most traditional house dish that is Tirashi, from simple to special, anyone is WONDERFUL!\n",
      "So, the place is really a small door, with only a small table inside. It opens at very select times and the demand is very high, so that when we arrived (around 8:30 pm), there were not many snacks. Anyway, we eat the best vatapá I've ever eaten and a rice with chicken and delicious jambú! I was told the menu of snacks of the day and my mouth watered, I wish I had arrived earlier! I recommend going early, for a snack in the late afternoon after tours in Belém and before returning to the place of lodging!\n",
      "I really liked the restaurant, because the service was very good and the view was wonderful, you could see Praia do Forte from there.

As we only had one night in the city, our idea was to visit another restaurant in the city, also starring, but the fact that the Mezzan chef worked at Fasano made us curious. We chose it.

      "The large venue is very well organized, with a toy library and live sound on some days of the week. I found the price of the cover charge to be very expensive - R $ 15.00 per person, which charges the bill too much. Prices in general are higher than those in the region, but I really liked the food. We were offered to try the meat disc but the disc was very raw and we didn't approve of the delicacy.\n",
      "We went to a work lunch on Ilha do Caranguejo, but as it was early, it seems to me that the kitchen was not yet ready.

For those who like sweet and sour dishes it's perfect! I, who eat in good restaurants every weekend, can say: one of the best dishes I've ever eaten! It is best to eat this with a view of the sea, taking caipiroskas of siriguela to the sound of the DJ in the background. To finish: THIS PLATE COST 36 REAL !!! And believe me, it is very well served! IT WAS SENSATIONAL!\n",
      "This restaurant features a good variety of fish from the Pantanal. It is possible to request in advance the Pacu roast, which is one of the specialties of the house. A little tumultuous atmosphere is noisy, as it is a restaurant for more than 200 people.\n",

The dishes are plentiful, serve 3 people well. Air conditioning, pleasant atmosphere, friendly service, reasonable price. A friend who asked for a portion of abará and acarajé praised it a lot.\n",
      "It was very good that the quality plummeted, I was having dinner there last week and unfortunately I found out that KAWA is not the same anymore. Fish served was not at all fresh, food was generally cold, shimeji was totally cold and salty, too much rice in sushi, service from the staff left something to be desired.Good thing São Paulo has other options.I DO NOT RECOMMEND !\n",
      "Restaurant with a high standard of quality and service, but sins a little in terms of hours. I arrived a few minutes before noon and they informed me that the restaurant was not open yet, they could have received me and informed me to wait on the restaurant premises.\n"

      "Very tasty dishes, always with the best ingredients, making this the best Japanese in Maceió, without a doubt. Thursday (lamen) and Friday (executive) lunches are also a good option.\n",
      "Wonderful food. The parmigiana file can eat about four people and has a divine flavor. There are also live crabs to choose from and eat on the spot.\n",
      "We went to lunch over the weekend, which raises the price of the carvery from $ 49.90 to $ 69.90. I was not expecting much for the value, because I knew it is not consistent with the market average. It is only reasonable. Few options for raw fish and seafood. Sushi with lots of rice and little fish. Many starters, which I don't like very much. Some adapted options are not Japanese. Not bad, at lunch of the week having the same options (variety and quantity) the price is right. Service a little lengthy and confusing, although friendly. I consider it a very average option. There is no parking, just on the street. It is small and has 2 floors.\n",
      "Very beautiful restaurant, well done food, but the service is terrible, waiters pass by and do not serve ....\n",
      "The place has a beautiful view, typical of the Northeast, this one is close to Maceió, but it sins in attendance, from the lack of information at the reception to the employees who spend more time paying attention on cell phones than the Tourists themselves, some did not know how to explain how the dishes were served or the quantity that was offered in the same, if it served one or two people well, it is difficult to pay to go somewhere and suffer from poor service inside.\n",
      "When entering the place it seemed a lot like Prêt à Manger but on a smaller scale: you enter and are faced with cold foods and snacks - which can be heated right there, then drink options and few tables. Good looking, but with fewer options and more expensive. For the hurry I was attended to well! I would suggest offering more fast food options (at least when I went I had a lot more snacks than food - which was salads and a few cups of pasta) and improving the cost-effectiveness ...\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, service from the staff left nothing to be desired, good quality food and very fair price\n",
      "Wonderful place, full of flavors and focused on healthy eating. My favorite place to eat in Porto.\n",
      "In case you think about enjoying a nice snack without weight on your conscience, whole grain bread with plenty of vegetables, combined in a beautiful flavor!\n",
      "The promotional plate advertised on the front was missing!The menu has more choice of chicken and meat than seafood, as the restaurant's proposal seemed to be.The dish I ordered, whose waiter said it served 4 people, only serves 3 at most!The portion of rice that comes as an accompaniment is very small.The fish came too oily and too salty!My table lacked oil and other spices that the neighboring tables had availableWhen I asked for the bill the waiter said that the service fee was optional, I said that I could put the fee and paid in cash. When I received the change, it was placed much more than the 10% that they had broken down in the account as optional, I felt stolen\n",
      "If you go to JP, you must visit this restaurant. Nice atmosphere, excellent food and fair price!\n",
      "great environments for all audiences, especially lovers of rock, it was where I met people from all over the world\n",
      "This has always been my favorite steakhouse but unfortunately the barbecue is no longer the same ...\n",
      "Although it is located in a place that is a little difficult to find on a cross from Rua Fonte do Boi (the same street as the Ibis and Mercure in Rio Vermelho), the search is worth it: the food is quality!\n",
      "Impeccable restaurant, we were in the restaurant with another couple of friends and we met Chef Fred who was at our table to know about the service and gave us indications of wonderful dishes, a true gastronomic experience ....I will be back for sure!\n",
      "Pizzeria with a simple yet cozy atmosphere, it has the best pizza I've ever eaten in my life! Thin pasta, cheeses and sauces of excellent quality make this place the best pizza in Salvador!\n",
      "Very nice place and with very good service. Good starters, but Shrimp obprato with tomatoes and noodles despite being very well served for two people was not tasty.\n",
      "You can not miss this steakhouse. It is a perfect place to have lunch with friends and family. Do not forget.\n",
      "Super nice atmosphere perfect service and well prepared food, we ate five dishes, all perfect\n",
      "The food is very good, depending on the time you go the service drops slightly due to the number of employees not being enough.\n",
      "Very nice and well structured restaurant. Diverse menu with featured shrimp dishes. But with good sun meat and an excellent cod pastry.\n",
      "Option for a quick snack in Brasilia Teimosa. Reasonable prices and popular snacks are the attraction of this place.\n",
      "I would like to praise the professionalism and friendliness of the staff Alex and Gil! I celebrated my birthday at Coco Bambu and was treated very well. Thank you !\n",
      "Wonderful service and delicious dishes. Despite the steep price it is worth visiting. The menu is always a surprise\n",
      "The food is excellent and the atmosphere is the same. But the service leaves much to be desired, especially for the amount paid for the service. We went on the weekend of the carnival holiday and although we arrived early and the restaurant was still empty, it took them a long time to take our order. Detail: they wrote down the dishes first, and only then the drinks.When serving the dish, my friend's glass of coca was dropped. Okay, super understandable, we are all subject to it. But at no time did they apologize, nor did they replace her drink that had just been opened. On the contrary, she had to ask for another that was charged. And, if that weren't enough, when cleaning the table (with no care), they spilled the soda spilled on my fiancé (what hadn't happened when the glass fell, happened when they were cleaning up the dirt. Unbelievable!).I went to another unit of Coco Bambu in Fortaleza (Coco Bambu Sul) and the service was completely different, exceptional. When I return to Fortaleza, I will certainly give preference to Coco Bambu Sul.\n",
      "Good service, tasty and well prepared dishes. Innovative flavors and delicious desserts. It gave us pleasure to visit this restaurant.\n",
      "beautiful place, great food. Very good service, all characterized, indescribable environment. worth knowing\n",
      "At the buffet the repositioning is a little slow, the items run out and take time to be replaced. The waiters were not very attentive to the operation of the hall, they kept their backs most of the time. We called and were not answered and the requests were slow to come to the table. I ordered a glass three times, questioned the delay and when the waiter arrived, he handed it to me with irony.The space is great, but the service needs to improve and professionalism too.\n",
      "Very good this restaurant !!!!! Very delicious food, with a lot of variety, beautiful environment, impeccable service, it should have all over Brazil.\n",
      "we visited this restaurant after eating a little at home. we enjoyed some dishes like the quail (great) the ravioli. lots of good ideas: mix local ingredients with international ingredients. only problem that the service does not match: be improved.\n",
      "Excellent pumpkin shrimp and grilled shrimp dish with garlic. I always go and the pattern didn't fall. I recommend! Better than the competitor!\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere as Shopping Leblon is very beautiful, sophisticated and has an incredible piano. Music spreads across all floors. The waiters are attentive but the Preco Salgado. My temaki was not as delicious compared to the Japanese tavern (much cheaper and much cheaper)\n",
      "I was at the restaurant hoping to repeat the Myk experience, but the disappointment was great.I waited for about 30 minutes and the waiters were overwhelmed, in a bad mood and struggling to serve customers. We ordered a squid snack that was bad and oily. The waiter left the plate on the counter, without even a napkin.The negroni came out watery, like Campari juice, the worst I've ever drank in my life. They need to review the cocktails too.When I asked for wine, I was informed that this place is not for drinking wine and if you want it has to be in the glass.Dinner with food at the most average, without any positive highlight.It needs to evolve a lot\n"

      "It took me a long time to taste Carne de Sol Caicó's food, and I was delighted when I tasted it. All very tasty, well executed, and the price is reasonable.\n",
      "Good service, very pleasant atmosphere, well frequented with great meat in a very pleasant region of the city.\n",
      "Excellent customer service - Congratulations to Juliana, Paulo, Lucas and Moacir. Exceptional.Punctual, organized, prompt and helpful.\n",

      "Great atmosphere, beautiful view! Differentiated service, especially when it comes to Rio de Janeiro !!! Good variety of dishes and snacks. Good quality food and beautiful presentation. Fair price! I recommend.\n",
      "Certainly the most tasty pizza I've tasted in recent times. Excellent service, everything was very fast and efficient. I advise you not to leave without first tasting the house wine.\n",
      "I really like to eat at cavanhas because it has several options, from snack to lunch, snack and etc. And at 373 I'm addicted to the alaminuta. The best in the center, especially the steak à parmegiana. You just have to be careful because there is another branch or franchise I don't know on the other side number 274 that I didn't like, burnt french fries bad minute ... the loureiro da silva is great too. As I study close, when I leave college I usually spend there with colleagues, I highly recommend these two!\n",
      "wonderful pizza, well stuffed, thick dough. Charming decor, has 2 floors. Chao covered in sand. Great service\n",
      "In terms of drinking there, the strong point is beer, and the customer himself can help himself or ask the employees for help. The service is aided by a lot of technology. The house mate is interesting and the artisanal sausage sandwich is very good. The friendliness of the attendants was something that left something to be desired, as well as the speed of service for things that did not involve food / drink orders. For dessert the strudel fell far short of expectations. Overall, it is a good place to visit.\n",
      "We went on Friday and was playing pop and rock. The band was very good and played a very lively repertoire. He played songs on demand, including Dire Straits at our request (surprised).Real prices and good sized portion, very well made. It is very worth knowing.\n",
      "Excellent place to take friends and socialize. Regional food. It is possible to eat tasty goat and other house specialties. Service note 10 and varied menu.\n",
      "Without a doubt the best restaurant of its kind in Brazil. All the sandwiches are fantastic and the restaurants like the containers are incredible tasteful !!!!\n",
      "Super nice atmosphere, excellent service in special Manolo- very polite and agile. Best restaurant in Salvador.\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, pleasant people, the location does not help much, as it is close to the Goiânia forum, for the amounts charged the service could be better.\n",
      "A very cool place to eat, for those who want a quick snack and enjoy a break from the day, at some point, and can have good dishes.\n",
      "Great service. The manager Bakhtiar super friendly and attentive. And the waiter Noah helped us a lot with the choice of dishes\n",
      "Super famous in Leblon, Veloso is always packed. Good option both for a post-beach lunch (excellent food), as well as to go out at night to chat and flirt with friends or warm up for a night out.The highlight of the bar is public, there are a lot of beautiful people having a beer on the sidewalk. Better than a lot of ballads in Rio.The service is ok and the prices are in the average of Rio. Both the draft beer and the original beer are always very cold and the snacks are all delicious.\n",
      "We like ceviche a lot. A good variety. Very good typical food options. The beer was cold and the location is great.\n",
      "This is a good restaurant in a very pleasant place. However the prices are somewhat high for the cuisine and simplicity of the place. The view of the Rio Niterói Bridge is interesting and the surrounding forest also contributes to the mild and pleasant climate.Currently, as it is fashionable, prices are out of control.\n",
      "Best oven-baked cod in Cuiabá. Excellent service. If you want to add egg to the cod, no problem, they add\n",
      "on the night of 28 December, thank mr. Pedro Jacks, excellent, attentive service. very nice place, all attention to my family dining with tranquility and quality. ah the delicious food. 1000 note.\n",
      "I had never understood why the Mangaí restaurant in João Pessoa does not allow pictures to be taken inside. But at the very moment when I set foot in Parraxaxá, I realized the reason! Parraxaxá is nothing more than an imitation of Mangaí, quite fajuta, by the way. The buffet is identical, but the decor does not reach the feet of the restaurant in Paraíba. The dishes were cold and I found a hair in the middle of the string beans. I would not return.\n",
      "It follows the pattern of the other houses in the chain, the same decoration, atmosphere and menu. The service went well, we sat at the table for almost 10 minutes without anyone coming to bring the menu, and it was not peak time, on the contrary, it was almost 3pm when we went to lunch and the restaurant was quite empty. The waiters, managers and other attendants talking, until a blessed soul appeared. We went to LUNCH MENU and ordered the starters which were delicious (corn and bacon soup is perfect) and while we were still at the entrance ... lunch arrives! The food came back after all, does it make sense to eat two dishes at the same time?Tasty and well served food, worth it.\n",
      "The restaurant is hidden away. When you open the gate of, apparently an ordinary house, you find an oriental-style building. The place is simple. Few tables and about eight seats at the counter. The difference is the food and the local atmosphere.The restaurant has existed for 17 years. Who makes all the cold dishes is the couple of owners, Julio and Lígia. Friendly and playful, they know almost all customers.The quality of the food is very good. The fish are fresh, selected and treated with care by Julio.The menu is lean and a la carte. But the prices are very honest for what they serve. It is spent for starter, combo and hot dish, in two people, practically what you spend in a carvery.For those who like the most traditional food I recommend (for those who can handle it they use natô, shissô, tororô, etc.).\n",
      "Family place, clean and well organized. Varied menu of soups and broths. It has natural juices, and tapioca. Well located in Aleixo, it has its own parking. I recommend.\n",
      "Beautiful, pleasant place, impeccable service and food grade 10 !!! Manioc cake with shrimp + grilled Mecca + cocada duo - try it !!\n",
      "Best Christmas food! We tried shrimp in pineapple, sensational, service note 10, another good experience in this wonderful city.\n",
      "Good place and great service. We were well received and paid no umbrellas or chairs upon consumption. We ordered a shrimp with sensational parmesan. Fair prices.\n",
      "The environment is super different. The feeling is that you are inside an authentic Italian Villa.The food is also well made and tasty.Worth knowing.There is space for closed events.\n",
      "We ordered a pizza that was on sale.The service was very fast and the wait was a good time.The pizza was delicious! Very warm!\n",
      "Restaurant for a very friendly Italian couple. Very good and abundant food. My husband and I ate, as indicated by Chef Lory, the homemade pasta trio prepared with care and creativity. More than recommended. On the next trip to Maceió, we will be back for sure. Congratulations to the couple!\n",
      "Nothing like enjoying the club and going to Chopão to take the famous '' Escaldado ''. The place is one of the oldest in the city, reflecting tradition, culture and meeting point for many friends. Great!\n",
      "Great atmosphere I visited on Sunday and even with the house full the service did not leave much to be desired, the order arrived quickly. Great food\n"

      "The food is simply divine. Although French, it has refinement in the right measure and is not that pedantic gourmet. Without a doubt it is the best hamburger in Porto Alegre, and still has those delicious rustic potatoes as a side dish. The environment is small. I went on a weekday and there were tables available, but I imagine that on a day with more demand I should create a queue. Either way, it's worth it. The service is good, and the owner, who stays at the register, is very friendly. Oh, and make no mistake: he is Uruguayan and will be offended if you ask if he is Argentine lol.\n",
      "Nice place and easy access. It has a varied menu and excellent service. Every Thursday there is a presentation by a saxophonist. It is worth checking.\n",

      "Thankful surprise! Great service, beautiful, cozy place. A charm to see the impeccable kitchen working ...Very creative menu, full of incredible, different options, combining flavors and aromas very well.Worthy of repetition, the entries and cover charge are DIVINE!I recommend ceviche, served in coconut.A good experience.\n",
      "I celebrated 5 years of marriage, I made a surprise for my wife, very pleasant atmosphere, great for those who want to have a romantic dinner. The food was very good, and very affordable, great drinks, I didn't like the price of the beer, which I ordered didn't come very cold. I recommend diced sun meat as a starter.\n",
      "Really, very good, but very expensive ... Now, everything that is good can be expensive. It is difficult to combine the good and cheap in restaurants in Salvador. Therefore, if you can and the money allows you to go. The view of Baía de Todos os Santos is stunning, worth it.\n",
      "The atmosphere is very relaxed, the service is very attentive and the food is spectacular, especially the ribs! It is not for nothing that there is always a queue to enter.\n",
      "The international shrimp is a delight.The service of waiter Felipe Brito scores 10, very fair price.\n",
      "one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten. the dough is extremely thin and light, where you fear the fear that is what really matters\n",
      "Great request. Buffet with a wide variety of salads and with the option of adding grilled meat, but the variety is so great that the grilled meat can be dispensed with.\n",
      "Beautiful place, super well located, wonderful service, and perfect food. The best rice and cuxá I've ever eaten in my life !!!!\n",
      "Great location, the restaurant, serves a wide variety of fish, the garnishes are free, but the price is quite salty but very worth it, I highly recommend meeting those who are passing through Cuiabá.\n",
      "Great atmosphere .. It is worth making a visit and enjoying the delights of the menu offered, in addition to the delicious dessert\n",
      "Great restaurant, excellent service. We went twice during our stay in Vitória and loved the pizza. Fine, crispy and quality pasta. For dessert I ordered a flan of sour cream with red fruit sauce and I loved it too!\n",
      "Very tasty meal. Very friendly and responsive service. I recommend for those who want to harvest well and at an affordable price\n",
      "Warm and friendly service.Variety of flavors.Quality in each food offered to the customer.Fair prices and compatible with what is offered!I recommend it to everyone!\n",
      "The draft beer is great always taken very cold, always great frequency, pleasant place and good service.\n",
      "The highlight of the restaurant is the service. In addition, the environment, the quality of the food, the price leave much to be desired. One of the worst restaurants I have ever been to.\n",
      "I went with a friend and ordered the fried fish. Two very large pieces of yellow hake came. There is plenty of rice, salad and black-eyed beans, all very tasty! The pitcher of P juice comes with a good amount, the pineapple with mint is very well made, as well as the strawberry caipirosca (one of the best prices I found in the city too). The waiter Gilmar is very attentive, very helpful and very friendly!\n",
      "Excellent wine list. First-rate service. Especially the flamboyant mall. Try the cod or risotto from the cerrado. Pure delight.\n",
      "Excellent food, pleasant and cool environment. Good prices, and huge variety at the buffet. Everything very well done.\n",
      "Located in João Alfredo, in Cidade Baixa it has a very cheap entrance, craft beers, live shows and wonderful cuisine. For those who like it, be sure to try the artisanal cachaças of pepper, honey and ginger, in addition to the lourival haystack.\n",
      "Varied pasta buffet, good atmosphere, good service, prices consistent with quality. Great option for group lunch!\n",

      "For the third time I choose the place to have lunch with the family. Very nice place and attentive waiters, even if on a very busy day they manage to serve satisfactorily. I only ate the chicken and the rump, they are two very well served dishes, excellent value for money. You still have to try the picanha and the fish.\n",
      "Shrimp carvery is $ 59 per person! For those who like shrimp it is a must! The carvery has about 12 options of shrimp portions made in the most diverse ways! I really enjoyed the shrimp in butter! The one I liked least was the shrimp lasagna! You can ask to repeat the most liked! But here's a tip! You'll eat so much that sometimes you can't even repeat it! Lol\n",
      "Porcão has its highlight, but it is not the best carvery in BH!Good for those who love rare meat (which goes on all the time) and not so much for those who prefer better done (which sometimes have to ask to pass).Variety of salads and good sushi !!Very good and attentive service!Very strange entrance after the ‘renovation’, but the main environment was very beautiful!The option to park is in the parking lot just because Avenida Raja is complicated ...\n",
      "I didn't find those things on the executive menu the day I went. Everything took too long and was not very tasty. For the price and for how much we hope I expected more. I'm a little lacking in the courage to go back there the other day to get rid of it.\n",

      "Despite not belonging to the main audience of the house (gamers), I was very satisfied with the environment, the service, the drinks and snacks. It's really worth it.\n",
      "Delicious bread is a typical Salvadorian snack. I know it since kindergarten. There is no party or big party here without him. And Alô Pãozinho is perfect for parties, snacks, as well as to take to eat at Porto da Barra beach. It also manufactures snacks and sweets and home delivery.\n"

      "I found an example to use in master's classes on quality perception. According to Paraduraman (1988) the quality of the service is evaluated by the consumer comparing his expectations and the perception he had of the service.I know the Montana Grill in Campinas as well as several express franchises spread across shopping malls in Brazil. So I really expected that the Christmas one would follow the same quality standard. I was surprised by the difference, or deja, very inferior. The meat was so tender that if more tenderizer was put in, it would melt, the carrot rice was very salty, half a dozen tomato cubes were the vinaigrette and ... the fried polenta, which is usually a delight in other franchises ... it looked like a square angú heated in a microwave !!!When I compare my assessment with that of other clients ... I notice differences, so I wonder if these clients' opinions would change when they meet the other quality franchises of the Montana Express chain !!!\n",
      "The tapioca from Casa de Taipa is simply wonderful! The fillings are varied, being able to choose between sweet or savory. Tapioca with shrimp and sun meat are delicious. The place is pleasant, with typical regional decoration and the service is fantastic.\n",

I come from a place where pork is a typical dish in the city, but I need to report it so that it gets better !! The place is very well decorated, nice waiters knowledgeable..but I'll tell you my experience: it cost us to access the place because there was street carnival, we waited and when we entered, we decided to try the tasting menu in order to know the best dishes of the house (I understand), but I believe we were very unlucky! Despite the magnificent appearance of everything that arrived at the table, after the first dish everyone else was a scare. I have a strong taste of pork in the breakfast drink, it looked like a broth but I didn’t feel any seasoning… no flavored butter, then pork sushi with a bitter taste, later a Parmigiana Eggplant that didn’t taste like that. The best dishes were the kibbeh, the panceta (a bit rubbery), the feijoada (normal) and the SanZe pork (I didn't find anything too much - the Paraguayan pork in my city has cassava, cheese) .. I got a certain fear at each next dish that would come. We didn't even like the dessert, which was mush, very simple and well presented, but so much sophistication made a common dish with a flavor that didn't harmonize (with goat's milk ice cream) .. If it were just me, I would say it was my particular taste, but we were in 4 and nobody left happy..still with an account of 700.00 and sad :( after the other day researching better about the place, I saw that they already had some alerts about that menu ... patience ..well sad\n",

It was so surprising that I thought it was fair to write this review.Congratulations to the kitchen team for the quality of the dishes. I ordered a filet sandwich with catupiry which was very well served. However, the highlight was the dessert: Petit Gateau de Buriti. Very tasty, surprising and original!Finally, congratulations to the team that delivers to your room. The gentleman who attended us was extremely friendly. Unfortunately I didn't get his name, but he was working on the night of the 22/09, so here are my thanks.\n",
      "Like basically every restaurant in Brazil, vegetarians and especially vegans are sick. there are very few options: white rice and lettuce, tomatoes and carrots, which is what I usually eat when I have lunch there.Apparently the options for those who eat meat are great, because I saw the people lounging, but for me, it was a very bad experience and I only went because it was the least worst in the place.The service is not bad, however.\n",
      "Super delicious food, variety of juices and other drinks. As I am a carnivore, I love a fillet of gorgonzola cheese. What bothers me are the mosquitoes, but it is not the restaurant's fault, as it is a wooded place ... but other than that, the rest is perfect.\n",
      "The place is uncomfortable, but the quality of the food makes up for the discomfort.For me, the best açaí is Du rei (strawberry açaí with condensed milk), the wonderful mozzarella pizza\n",
      "Delicious food, super caring service and cozy atmosphere! Alex made a super late reservation for me and the waiters just sympathy. Food only closes with a flourish.\n",
      "Great service, well-produced and hearty dishes in a pleasant environment. The space is good with lots of location options to choose from.\n",
      "A place concerned with how much you will spend.I didn't find the mozzarella pizza on the menu, and the unfriendly waiter said it was the cheapest on the menu, marguerita ... you just had to ask to remove the tomato). And it didn't do much to ask for just 1 serving of calabrian bread! for these people it had to be at least 2. We regret not getting up and going to another place after that: the pizza is weak (dough that looks like pre-baked, sauce that looks like pulp ..), they get it wrong in the Mozzarella ... Get out of the dough, without grace. Only the cold beer was saved.\n",
      "Walking on the Ponta Negra seafront, it is a good alternative for those who want a quick and good quality meal.What impressed me was the speed, the pizza was ready in less than 15 minutes, even with the fulfillment of other orders at the other tables.Just a tip, avoid the tables by the window to the street, otherwise you will certainly have the meal interrupted with orders.\n",
      "It is interesting, but I found the pizza cheese a little sickening. I also didn't like the fact that there was no ketchup on the premises.\n",
      "Small but cozy atmosphere. Dishes well prepared and served. Seasoning to the point. Worth knowing. I intend to go back.\n",
      "Although the place appears to be very sophisticated, the price is very affordable. Christmas rocks in restaurants to eat!\n",
      "Restaurant very well installed and decorated, with efficient reception, perfect air conditioning. We had a half hour wait due to demand, but after choosing the meal, we were served in 10 minutes. We dined (couple) a Terra Brasilis shrimp, water and a glass of white wine. Total cost R $ 106.70 serving two people well.\n",
      "Special service! I recommend international shrimp, which serves up to four people, in addition to the caipirinhas, which are super stylized!\n",
      "The restaurant is beautiful and the service is excellent. We ordered the restaurant's flagship (jangadeiro shrimp from Alagoas) which costs around 90 reais. Although the dish is delicious we think that for the size of the dish there were few shrimp. Despite this, it was very worthwhile to visit the restaurant.\n",
      "They are good at all times, from the reception to when you leave. Wonderful service from the waitstaff, maitre d 'comes to the table to ask if you are being well served, waffles They are all very friendly and helpful, the food is not even mentioned!Congratulations to the whole team !!\n",
      "The first time I was at Nez, it was due to the dish of good memories, we liked everything so much that we decided to come back taking a couple of friends to meet him, as a result, again we approved everything we tried. I only make one caveat, I was unable to speak on the phone to make a reservation, I was afraid it was closed on Saturday night, as it was holy week, but through information from the branch on a good trip, they assured us it was open.\n",
      "Impeccable service! Special place! Wonderful food! I will always repeat! Congratulations to the boss! I just got lost when looking for him ... But it was worth it!\n",
      "Like all restaurants in this chain, it has a variety of sandwiches (hamburgers), ice cream; the people who work in Boa Vista still have to be more attentive to the public, but I think that little by little they will learn to be more cut\n",
      "Shot, the best tambaqui I've ever eaten in my life!I ordered the half portion (which serves two easy) and paid 60 Reais, with two more beers.Go with faith that you will be happy!\n",
      "Excellent service, noble meats and a wonderful buffet with Japanese food.Very good price too!\n",
      "Good option for those who live on this side of town.Good pizza, good service and recommend.Pizza price equivalent to other famous + pizzerias.The Japanese didn't eat that vex, but it seemed well prepared. Price? Above average.\n",
      "Very good food, super nice atmosphere. Excellent place for dinner for two or dinner with friends.Good wine list and a varied menu.It is worth mentioning that it is possible to bring your own wine!Very good, I recommend...\n",
      "As I am a fan of shrimp, I could not miss visiting. Very good. Efficient service. The price, although a little steep, is compatible with most restaurants of its level.\n",
      "Very good, I really liked it. It has external space, air-conditioned, reserved, for party. Very good live music, snake cover with good price. The products are too good, the beer is always cold, the food is delicious and in large quantities. The service leaves a little to be desired, but because the space is always full. Beautiful people abound.\n",
      "we were unable to sit outside, but the quality of the food paid off. we chose octopus and tuna - both divine. the pure with truffled oil (as well as almost everything in the restaurant!) was delicious.\n",
      "The tapiocas are very good and the atmosphere is very pleasant, although small. The decoration resembles the nordestino and has themed hats for those who want to take a photo. We don't like the egg pancake. On the other hand, the Italian straw tapioca is very tasty. Great for those who love candy.\n",
      "For those who like to taste snacks ... better than Valadares does not have ... to have an idea, there are even rooster testicles and a wide variety of other snacks, not to mention the draft beer that is delicious ... I have known this house since 1976 ...\n",
      "Pizza of excellent quality, with top quality ingredients. Special highlight for the service of the Welington manager. The unique wine cellar in town and the carbonara pizza are delicious! I recommend it to everyone who is looking for a special place to enjoy a good time with the people they love.\n",
      "Very nice to drink a cold beer with friends, chat and enjoy music (when there are events).\n",
      "I went by a friend's recommendation and it is sooo much better than described!The Cheese salad is sensational, the meat is delicious, the soft bread and the mayonnaise is VERY tasty. The snack is just right, it is not one of those that keep dismantling everything.The fries come at the right point and the waiters are very attentive.I ate 2 snacks, pure gluttony!When I asked for the 2nd the waiter thought I was even kidding 😬I've eaten a wonderful burger in a lot of places and this one is absolutely in my TOP 5, namely:1st: I Love Burger (Las Vegas / USA), unfortunately closed 😭2nd: Burger Fi (Orlando / USA, especially the CEO burger)3rd: Smash Burger (Los Angeles / USA, the Truffle Mushroom Swiss snack)4th: Five Guys (Naples / USA, any burger!)5th: A Chapa (São Paulo / BRA)Congratulations on the burger and service, I'll be back for sure!\n"

      "Much is said about the best X-salad in São Paulo. I can say that he is at Kaskata's Lanches. Tomato sauce and mayonnaise are registered trademarks. I can say, put Seo Osvaldo in your pocket in all aspects, especially in customer service. Be sure to eat the condensed milk pudding for dessert.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant, with helpful, quick and polite waiters, where they even gave me a menu to take to the hotel and when I came back for lunch I had already chosen the order. Prices excellent. First class food, with great seasoning and quantity.\n",

      "Good food and good service, they could improve the place, increase the clientele, even so, it's worth it for the quality of the meat.\n",
      "sorry to disappoint them but don’t get into the wave of this chewing gum nothing more than a pile of melted cheese on top that takes away all the flavor of the shrimp or maybe there was shrimp on the plate\n",

      "Cariri's main lounge has several tables and, at the end of the day, there is always live music, which makes the atmosphere super lively! For those who wish to dance, there is a ballroom in the back that works at night with forró (but in the main hall, many people usually get up from their tables to dance!). Just from getting very full, the waiters are able to serve you in an attentive and prompt manner! I recommend the siriguela caipi: delicious!\n",
      "We ordered the menu at the reception and heard from the waiter: Take it there. After waiting for our password, the waiter simply called our number and said: Sit there pointing to the table, far away, leaving us at the reception with all our drinks without even helping us with glasses and bottles.\n",
      "I had already come to this restaurant and I was disappointed with the quality of the food presented today 06/09/2016, very small portion of the shrimp on the breath, small and tasteless crab and no seasoning file. Criticizing for improvement. It was good.\n",

It is a self-service that has a bit of everything from Minas Gerais cuisine, angu, bean soup, crackling, sausage, molasses and many other dishes and, of course, the house cachaça is very special and the desserts are simply delicious. First-rate service. I will return for sure!\n",
      "In the heart of Catete, the Catete Grill restaurant is a mix of self service and steakhouse, with dishes based on meat, fish and seafood. The variety of salads does not leave fans of vegetarian food without options. Pleasant atmosphere and price compatible with quality. It is not cheap, but it is the best in the area for a meal without frills.\n",
      "The meat rotation costs between R $ 35.00 and R $ 50.00, depending on whether you choose to receive steak. The traditional show is included in any of the values. Drinks apart. It is worth going and staying a long time. The show usually starts at 9:15 pm (more or less).\n",
      "The service is perfect. The variety of snacks is huge and very tasty. I recommend the pork knee or the sun meat with rennet cheese. The location is great inside a big city mall.\n",
      "This is my third evaluation and I prove: The Best Restaurant in Natal RN!Mainly for its cuisine and of course, fresh prawns and with very varied recipes.You may even find the price high, but they are well served and you eat until you get bored.At the entrance there are great savory options such as: The traditional shrimp pastry that I have never eaten anywhere. Even if you find the restaurant crowded, the waiting time is approx. 40 minutes and you don't even feel it.Worth it !!!!\n",

      "The Cabana do Sol restaurant is one of the best known, popular and valued typical food restaurants in the Northeast of São Luís, MA. It maintains a high standard of quality, serving enough and sufficient patrons for five people, which turns out to be a good cost-benefit ratio. The service is generally good, with parking and other attractions.\n",
      "The restaurant has great options on the regular menu and the executive menu. It also offers interesting wine options. But remember it is a sophisticated restaurant with French cuisine. I don't expect generous portions and a dish to share. But it is a very rich experience in flavors and combinations.\n",
      "We were there for lunch yesterday and we really liked the food, very tasty, and especially the service from Artur, very kind and attentive. The place is small, but very tidy.We recommend!\n",
      "If you don't want to participate in a firework show and want to eat a good barbecue this is one of the best places in Porto Alegre for that. Press for agile, polite and simple service. Meats are prepared at the right spot and served quickly to your table. The maminha and the traditional mayonnaise salad are a must. Remembering again, the place is simple, there is no parking, no shows, no music, no card payment machine or a thousand accessories. Go if you like a good barbecue and want to eat well without caring about so many other things.For those who know the gringos in the countryside steakhouses, this is exactly the same.\n",
      "Until then I hadn’t tried pastrami, it’s very tasty, the snack is a perfect combination and the special cream is too much, you can divide the potato and the snack in 2 people, but the prices are a little high\n",

      "We took the opportunity to visit São Paulo and went to the delicious Bexiga neighborhood to visit one of Henrique Fogaça's restaurants. The Restaurant impresses with the care of the lounge. Well decorated, well lit, without much noise and without that unnecessary luxury.We suffered with a small delay at the table, but it was noticed by the manager, who already served us with courtesy. We opted for two starters, a beautiful and tasty arugula salad with figs, raw ham and raspberry vinegar and interesting rice balls with a strong passion fruit chipotle, present and sparkling. Main dishes, a perfect duck magret with surprising and interesting tangerine risotto (a recipe that we will risk at home); and a pork palette confit with mashed potatoes, gorgonzola and cavolonero. Strong and full of flavor.To close, a chocolate cigar (crunchy dark chocolate pastry, filled with patisserie cream with Callebaut and pistachio ice cream), which promised more and a beautiful brigadeiro with Jack Daniel's Honey, vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup and crispy chestnut cashew that is worth every calorie.The food is very well done, the service works and the place is very pleasant.\n",
      "Wonderful! Very varied kg food, we are from RJ and had black beans (my daughter loved it). The dishes are very natural. The decoration with plants brings tranquility to the environment.

      "I wanted to celebrate my birthday and I didn't know the Gurumê, I just had my son say that it was wonderful.I went to lunch, it was a Friday and there was a waiting line, we waited little to taste the delicious dishes.Everyone's tip was to start with shrimp popcorn that should be refilled lol, wonderful!Hot Philadelfia loved it and it was divine, then we asked for help because we didn't like the raw part, but the warm dishes.The waiter's tip was Ebiten Gurumê, delicious, but the desire was great to order the shrimp pioca again.I found the service very good, it didn't take long to prepare the dish and it comes well presented.A fondness of the Gurumê is that the birthday boy wins the dessert and was divine.The restaurant is very large, of course, very pleasant and eager to return.A great choice for those who don't know.\n",
      "A familiar and pleasant environment. I liked the service and the relative speed of service. I did not like the care with the bathrooms, precisely the wastebaskets that should be changed with shorter intervals when very frequented.\n",
      "without a doubt it is the best place to snack, with quality, great price, people who complain about this place do not know what they say, they need to give a second chance because the intention of it is always perfect.\n",

So it is good to enjoy it, because it should be very busy soon!\n",

I look forward to a new meeting.Congratulations to Coco Bamboo for these employees.\n",
      "I had a frustration. We wanted to know this restaurant for a long time.The service is excellent, great atmosphere.The disappointment was the steaks. The picanha, for example, you felt because it was not fresh. The normal rib. Tasteless sheep.Great salads, but the meat that is the flagship of the house did not please.\n",

      "Nice place, with good service, well decorated, delicious food and good soundtrack. A good place to meet friends.\n",
      "In addition to the super relaxed air and for all audiences (couples, family with and without children, friends ...) the drinks are delicious (worth a strawberry with lemon, whose flavor is difficult to explain as well as exotic), The menu is eclectic, including vegetarians who want to accompany carnivorous friends.

      "After 3 hours of waiting, and many bad looks, to get a table (very insistently) we received the carvery (R $ 99.00) not as good as expected. Despite having a great variety, the carvery sins for its way of acting. Waiters take trays with specific sushi and that's why we ended up not eating all the available varieties. Even asking for 2 ... 3 times items like tarare and wasabi were never delivered. In the end, they “suggest” a service charge of 13%. To improve they need more communication between employees and a better turnover of waiters.\n"

The price of this dish is around R $ 48.00, just to get an idea of ​​the cost-benefit.

Worth a stop for an afternoon coffee ..\n",
      "A nice restaurant with a different wine list and great options on the menu. I suggest the salmon dish and the wine “Primitivo de Manduria”.\n",
      "Mangai is traditional in Natal and the right choice for everyone who will visit the city. The restaurant is self-service and everything is delicious !!\n",
      "The pizzas are very good! From the pasta (very reminiscent of the Italians), the sauce is delicious and the ingredients of the toppings are very high quality. Pleasant atmosphere, piano. Usually there are queues on Saturdays after 8:30 pm.\n",
      "Super well frequented place, very pleasant with great drink options and good dishes.I just make a suggestion to include some dish options for vegetarians.\n",
      "Very good portions, very cold beers. The menu is displayed on the wall. Anyone can see. However, as the bar is well frequented, the service is kind of to be desired. The waiters are very attentive when they come to you. Be smart because they spend serving things that you think are complimentary, but it's all paid for.\n",
      "Sophisticated and traditional restaurant. Specialty mainly fish and seafood. Good service but prices are very high, according to the restaurant's standard\n",
      "A disappointment. I was recommended the restaurant, which already has some reputation. I found the food very bad. No seasoning and no taste. I ordered a shrimp stew and it looked like cornstarch with shrimp. For the price charged, you can eat at Adegão Português, which is no match. The place is squeezed, disorganized and hot. It is only worth it for the waiters who are very friendly. Who likes good food, does not come back.\n",
      "My husband and I spent a week in Maceió, and we went on the last night (14/08/18) to meet Janga. We arrived early, around 7 pm and got a good table. We were very well attended by Jeff, to whom we explained that my husband did not eat fish or seafood, and that I was very eager to eat lobster. The dishes served there are all for two or three people. Jeff offered us the solution of ordering two individual dishes, which are not on the menu. I ordered lobster (two small ones were served) with lemon risotto and my husband ordered a fillet (meat) with cheese rice.The food was delicious, however, as there was a lot of risotto and rice in relation to the protein served, a medium dish for each of us, at least half of each dish was left.The wine served and the dessert were also excellent.The only thing, however, was when we asked for the bill and realized that each dish was charged individually: lobster, meat, risotto and cheese rice for about R $ 40 each dish. That is, we pay around R $ 150, only on the dishes. The dish for 2 people costs 80 to 100 reais.But, as they made an exception, we accepted the value.We will only leave the tip for couples who do not have the same taste for the main course or stop going or get ready to pay the amount that would be for three people.As for Janga, I ask you to evaluate the possibility of serving individual dishes at a fair price, as I realized that several couples have the same problem when trying to go to the restaurant. And continue with the great food and service.\n"

      "A good place mainly for a beer and snacks. It has a specialty in chicken, the food is good. Hot but the chicken is a little bigger than a quail. I would forgive a black man other than a chicken. Positive point is the on-site parking and the location close to the sea.\n",

      "Very pleasant atmosphere, but full and busy, experienced waiters, delicious and fast food. Voted best restaurant in BH in 2017, Taste Vin manages to capture the customer with the most refined flavors of French cuisine. The interesting thing is that one of the owners, chef Rodrigo Fonseca, interacts with customers at the end of the gastronomic experience.\n",
      "Simple place with very good cuisine. There is the famous seafood rice, with a fair price where up to three people can eat ... they should serve half a plate, because if you are alone, I do not recommend it, as there will be food left. Hake is one of the best I've ever eaten. Efficient and friendly service. If you don't mind being in a very simple place like a beach hut, throw yourself and enjoy the view of the sea and the breeze that hits your face. Parking along the coast. Cold beer and WI FI\n",
      "Great pizza options, all very good! It also serves the option of Open Wine. Fair enough and unique flavor!\n",

      "I went with my girlfriend to Chez Heaven for a Friday lunch. We ordered the executive dish. We had to wait an hour and a half until the main course arrived, after complaining three times, and another half hour for dessert. The food was ok, nothing exceptional. The restaurant bears the name of an ex-Masterchef participant and this is just an advertisement, the food of the place is not the height. We do not pay for the service, which in this so special restaurant is 12%.\n",
      "I really like Saborido. My favorites are: chicken with olives, banana with cheese and cinnamon, and mini portions of cheese. They are well filled, and the service is super fast. A great option for those who like pastel.\n",

      "Nice atmosphere in the Lourdes neighborhood. The food we ate left something to be desired. Breaded filet with chedar and fried polenta. The portion does not serve two people well, it doesn’t look like a fillet, the sauce tastes more like flour than chedar and the polenta is not the best, it was cold.\n",
      "A giant dish of shrimp with dried meat that serves 3 or even 4 people for R $ 85 reais. Very tasty! They have a very different way of putting together the dish: they put the rice under the platter and the creamy mixture on top, it ends up being kind of a risotto.\n"

      "The pizzas are good but they are nothing special and the place is beautiful. I think it's not worth the price they charge ... hard to spend less than R $ 50.00 per person to eat pizzas that have nothing special. For that amount there are better places in POA.\n",

Very beautiful place, great service and tasty dishes, very different from everything you see here.It is a proposal for those who like avant-garde places.If you like news and know exotic places, take a chance!\n",

It has a good wine list!Very nicely decorated environment.\n",

Regarding the meat, I found it very weak the day I was there. Few varieties, hard meat and not very tasty. After a few attempts, I dedicated myself to the buffet and Japanese. The value of R $ 29.90 is fair for the set, but as a steakhouse it is very weak.\n",

The meal is really good, so it justifies that it is always full no matter which Outback you chose.Don't leave without trying: Blooming Onion (that fried onion with an exceptional sauce) and Ribs on the Barbie.The service is almost always good.

      "Today I had an unforgettable experience at Rede Fasano. It started at 12:20 pm and ended at 5:40 pm when I gave up insisting on Trattoria Fasano and the parking lot that serves the house. I arrived at 12:20 pm with my car working perfectly and gave it to the valet. I went into the restaurant and my guests were already waiting where I had to beg 3 times to have a waiter at my table. When that waiter arrived he asked me what I wanted to drink .. hi? I ordered the wine and drinks list. Then I had to beg 2 times for the cover to come. Main course I ordered a well done lamb curd and a caprese salad and they brought me a bleeding carré and another salad that was not the caprese. I took a deep breath .. At breakfast the petit four was placed on the table after 10 minutes that the coffee had already been served .. that is .. no one else would eat. but the grand finalle was when they brought my car with the alarm going off, flashing and the worst with the broken control. I was trying to resolve with the valet until 17:00 hours where he had the courage to say - Mr. Mauro that I have to prove that they damaged ... hi? I delivered my car without any problem and the vehicle returned with the control broken and all decoded .... I still had to hear that I would have to prove it because he needs to discount from the employee because the union demanded ... etc etc ... End of story my car at this moment is going to Brabus Mitsubishi being towed by my insurance from Allianz .. Full Thursday I am without a car I will stay the weekend because the dealership cannot answer it tomorrow. In other words, my account at Fasano without alcohol was 1,073.88 for 5 people. The parking charged by Fasano is R $ 32.00. In addition to all the expenses that I will have with taxi until the dealership fixes the control as well as the expenses with the dealership's control and the use of the winch. What country is this ?? That every day more the provision of service is terrible and we are still hostage. It is unfortunate that a network like Fasano provides this experience to the customer. My name is Edisia Marques de Almeida: edisiaa@gmail.com and I hope at least your dignity to repair all the trouble I am having due to having lunch at the restaurant Trattoria Fasano.\n",
      "Undoubtedly one of the best dishes I've ever had the pleasure of tasting: eisbein. Because they recommended me, I overcame prejudice and proved it. I liked it so much that I came back to repeat it a few times. The service at the place is excellent, and the other dishes I have tasted were also great. It is worth asking for the submarine and keep the mug. It is collectible and has all the flags and coats of German states. I always recommend this bar to everyone.\n",
      "What is the difference between Copacabana and Ipanema! Service here is wonderful, attentive, and shows your care. Delicious food, well ... Had the lasagna- it was perfect, tasty. My wife had the shrimp ravioli and she said this could be one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. Easy to reach by metro, nice and safe area too. We love the food, atmosphere and price correctly.\n",
      "Restaurant known on the spot, with tasty food and a good menu of typical foods. Very cold beer and great priceI suggest jam of dried meat and fish board.\n",
      "The restaurant has nothing special.The dishes are expensive and nothing much.The best dish is the feijoada which is served every Friday.The good thing about the establishment is that you can reserve tables for lunch with a large number of people.\n",
      "Excellent service, attentive waiters, good location with total security. Highlight for Tiramisu, served with own made paçoca. Divine handmade draft beer.\n",
      "I went to this restaurant in 2009 and 2011, and at that time it was a much better restaurant in every way, from the service to the level of food. The last time I went, September 2015, it was not as good as it was before, the service dropped a lot, even though the food was still nice and cost-effective.\n",

About the restaurant's cuisine: I really liked it a lot. There was a little problem with the entrance, but Chef Claudemir Barros personally came to the table to apologize, I found the attitude very noble on his part.Ps :. The presentations of the dishes were wonderful.\n",
      "The waiter who served us very kindly but the rest of the staff left something to be desired in terms of kindness. insufficient food quality.Poorly cooked pasta, sad Bolognese sauce. Not fresh fish. Starter and pasta without bread included as usual in Italy and Italian restaurants.Tax cupoun only charging.Who really wants good and Italian food will have other better options in sp.As an Italian in Brazil, I had high expectations for restaurants in Eataly but were disappointed.\n",
      "I always come back when I come to Rio. Ambience delights! Great food! Excellent location and service. I recommend\n",
      "I loved the pizza. The service is very responsive and the atmosphere is cozy. The waiters are not the friendliest in the world, but they are certainly efficient.\n",
      "great place to have fun with friends basic menu at a bar, but with good barbecue options.\n",
      "Very good service, Thiago attended usA great professional, good music and nice place\n",
      "Very bad place to eat. Lousy service, food takes too long, not to mention the high price.\n",
      "Average food with prices above average for the quality offered, not pleasant external environment, functional service.\n",
      "Local with decoration and regional food on a whim! There is a buffet per kilo, both for lunch and dinner, which is practical and allows you to try different dishes. In addition there is a menu with options for snacks, such as tapioca that are not on the buffet. Be sure to finish with a coffee and a portion of manioc bread, it is toasted on the plate with butter, a delight! they have an area with natural ventilation and another heated, for all tastes!\n",
      "I was at the bar and I was surprised pm the quality of the service and drinks, all very fast and with great quality thank you to the whole team !!!\n",
      "Certainly the best burger I've ever eaten. Very tasty, beautiful and pleasant place, great service and the menu is excellent.The roasted heart of palm is famous and very tasty, but the burger is divine!Worth knowing!\n",
      "Recommended for a celebratory dinner or with friends and family. Macunaima is very good in terms of cost benefit. The price is great, the varieties of pizzas and crepes, not to mention the various pastas, all warm and delicious. The waiters sometimes take a long time to serve the tables further away from the kitchen, but the service provided by the education and respect for customers is very good. Table reservation is a very positive point, as it is done in an organized way through email and with prior confirmation from the restaurant. The place is well lit and well located.\n",
      "Restaurant located in Setúbal.very good location, very pleasant environment, reasonable price.lots of good pasta, pizza, and meat.I recommend.\n",
      "An option for those who like variety and quality !! With barbecue and hearty self service. I really like having lunch at Santa Rita\n",
      "Great atmosphere, excellent food and differentiated service from Lucas! I highly recommend the establishment\n",
      "We went with great expectation to experience the sensations that are legitimately expected when tasting the dishes of a tasting menu in a renowned restaurant. At first, the food was really good, the place was full, the expectation only increased. But to our surprise the gap between the plates of tiny portions was absurdly large. We always asked the waiter to inform us about the next dish, and we said we were expecting, but nothing to bring the dishes in a reasonable time. Something very unpleasant: we were exhausted at the table, it took more than three hours to receive the savory dishes, and the forecast that was given to us as soon as we arrived was from 1h30 to 2h in total duration. Anyway, we gave up waiting for the rest of the desserts, or the time at the table would certainly exceed 4 hours. But the biggest disappointment was yet to come: the restaurant's justification was that we were tired of not ordering wine! (Repeat: the forecast they gave us was an hour and a half to two hours). Anyway, we left there about three and a half hours later, a very bad memory, unfortunately.\n",
      "Delicious pizzas, sweet or savory, with thin and crunchy dough. They also accept orders for home delivery and have a wide and wide variety of drinks.\n",
      "Delicious snack! Great service, super pleasant atmosphere, varied menu, cost-effective value!\n",
      "Traditional breakfast with quality and cleanliness. At dinner orders take too long and it gave me the impression that they were not trained for dinner.\n",
      "Tasty food in an inspiring environment ... Great for a dinner for two, perfect place for wine lovers, who can choose what to drink right in the cellar located at the entrance. It almost always offers live music, which makes everything even better !!!\n",
      "The one to start the night in good company over a beer. Good snacks and good service. The place is easily accessible.\n",
      "The fast food restaurant, nestling in the wonderful Jardim de Napoli in Higienópolis, is as good as Matriz.Incredible flavor, efficient service and with a difference from all other restaurants in the food court: they take the dish to your table when they are ready!Great for quick meals, I recommend.\n",
      "Imagine eating pizza with your hand? It's in Vignolia. Pizza with super thin and delicious dough. The doughs are also very good. It is a higher price. Worth it.\n",
      "The bakery is well hidden in Antonio de Albuquerque and is not as good as the others in the chain. As it has little movement, it is difficult to find fresh items\n",
      "New place. Beautiful. Good food. Good coffee and afternoon snack. Nice lunch.Lousy service. It always goes wrong. They hit their heads. Weighing bread without organization. In the restaurant lost waiters. Oh, a place like that with such bad service.\n",
      "I was there for dinner. I arrived early and some people had lunch, which I believe is the best proposal in the place.\n",
      "Super nice atmosphere and very well prepared dishes. Noble meats and outstanding service. Very prepared waiters\n",
      "wonderful environment, view of the Madeira River, I emphasize for the service of your collaborators, especially the waiter Raimundinho\n",
      "I really liked the food, the atmosphere, but the waiter was very disrespectful to my fiancee and I, would come back one day, but the waiters' attitude made me change my mind ...\n",
      "The location is excellent for those staying in the hotel sector (north, nearest, or south). It has many delicious options of hot dishes and desserts and some salads (the other unit, Lago Sul, is much bigger and has a lot more salad options and a little more of the rest too) and has a wonderful atmosphere. But arrive around noon or just before. He usually sells out quickly. There is (paid) parking at the mall which has undergone a good and transformative renovation. It is not a seafood restaurant exclusively, but it has seafood, meats, chicken, creams, farofas, salads ... it's too much, people !!! Mangai started in João Pessoa, where the matriarch started to make warm to sell and then the children started to help and the business grew. Today, in addition to producing vegetables and raising cattle on their farms in Paraíba, they have this initial restaurant (the smallest and cheapest of all), another in Natal (slightly more expensive and much larger than JP's) and 2 in Brasilia, the most expensive of all, with Lago being the largest of all and Shopping ID is quite large as well. In all of them, you have the option of picking up banana (s) available on one of the walls. Ah, there are also wonderful juices. I love cashew juice, but it has something for everyone. They also pass later, but not always, selling the manioc / cassava / cassava breads. Cute and warm, that we end up taking home at one time or another. It's not cheap, but I've seen so many restaurants around here at this price without offering even half of their buffets, in quantity and quality, which I think is worth it! Anyway ... I LOVE MANGAI, whatever it is. Near the cashiers, there are handicrafts and treats for sale, in case you are in a hurry and have no way to pass at the TV Tower Fair. It is frequented by families (with or without children and teenagers), on business, by friends, for many birthday celebrations (and then they, after proof by the RG, they serve the top hat and sing the congratulations). The attendants are very attentive and dress in typical clothes. At the end, near the door, there is a free coffee for you to close with another key. WORTH EVERY BOW!\n"

      "Pizzeria very well located, pleasant, romantic and with a pleasant climate.Delicious Pizza, super thin dough and a size you can taste and you can eat many pieces.I LOVED IT!!!!I recommend.\n",
      "Very pleasant atmosphere, very American style, plays a loan shark song that goes well with the place. Very good service. I had a burger and fries and it was delicious. The fries came well served with a slightly spicy sauce and the hamburger was very tasty. For dessert, the attendant suggested the cheesecake with red fruit sauce that Dona had made today and it was super fresh and very good !! I recommend!!\n",
      "I gave a bad grade because I was very poorly attended. The atmosphere is very pleasant, the food is very good ... the pizza I found excellent, but my service (waiter) left me with hatred and I will burn the establishment for everyone.I'll tell the case to try to understand: We arrived tonight to celebrate the birthday of a cousin of mine, and as soon as I arrived the waiter was already showing the menu and asking what we were going to order. Right away I didn't like it, because of his haste to embarrass us. After that he insisted for another 3x. Then I placed the order.The worst was in the end, after paying a bill of R $ 500, half the people left and we were still at the table talking. It was where we asked to separate the table and remove the plates and glasses, as we would only be in one and the waiter said no. I was surprised and asked again if he could clear the table and clean it and once again I said that I needed to remove the second table for us to sit and he said: I will not remove it and if you want to sit, put the chairs on the other side. Summarizing Lousy Service. I HAD! I NEVER IN MY LIFE WAS THROUGH SUCH CONSTRAINMENT AND WORST, PAYING FOR THE SERVICE. IT WASN'T TAKING ANY FAVOR ... THE MONEY IS MINE AND I EAT ANY SINGER EVER MORE THERE.\n",
      "We went to a happy hour, a table of cold cuts and typical foods and the delicious draft beer typical of the region, delicious !!!\n",
      "I had already visited the restaurant several times and unfortunately when I returned after a long time I had a surprise that was not the best. The food itself continues as it always has been, generous dishes, well seasoned in the best American style (although more expensive than the competitor) still worth not having the same rows. However, for the first time, I was served in an unusual way, the dishes took a long time to be served, the attendants seemed scattered and the sound was very loud. I believe it was a time of mistakes that will not be repeated.\n",
      "Well, when I say everything the same it is because I did not disappoint in any of the chain's restaurants, always the good service, and the same food, I forgot the photo because it was a working lunch, but we ate a dish called: fisherman's net\n",
      "I celebrated my birthday in this place. We booked a table and went for the first time. It was a great gift. Differentiated service and several options of prices and dishes. Drinks of all kinds. Tasteful decor. Valet parking. I want to go back.\n",
      "After the hamburger fever, only the best establish themselves.HDO is, in my opinion, the best in João Pessoa.The Rib Burger is the best I've ever eaten.\n",
      "Did not like. Bad service, cold food, no seasoning ... I think it needs to improve a lot, including the meat variation.\n",
      "Good music, pleasant atmosphere for all audiences, those who enjoy ballads or bars find the solution in one place! I love!!\n",
      "20 beer toes. Various types, to please everyone. Lots of quality, both in the beers and the service.It is worth visiting and becoming a customer!If Fábio recommends a beer, go for it. He rarely gets it right!\n",
      "The food is not the best, the atmosphere is noisy, the tables are very close to each other. This means that if someone wants to pass without bumping into people, they need to ask the other to get up. In particular, I find it extremely unpleasant. Waiters only serve tables that are drinking beer well. If you ask for juice or water, forget it, you will only be served every 1 hour after half an hour waving. It seems to be a good option for those who are looking for partying and enjoy country music.\n",
      "The ambience of the restaurant is in good taste. A home with vintage features, cozy and relaxed.Self service options are limited, but with a good seasoning. Homemade food well done. When I went, it was after 3 pm and I still had good options.There are not many dessert options.And it has a good service. I'll be back!\n",
      "I have been attending the Napoli Garden since I was a child and I have never been disappointed. Delicious food!!! The combination of gnocci to sugo with popetone or parmeggiana is unbeatable. Anyone who likes Italian food should know it!\n",
      "Paulistinha is one of the most traditional pizzeria chains in Aracaju. It is worth going there. The pizza there is very tasty.\n",
      "Impeccable service from reception to departure. I emphasize that the table was never dirty or disorganized at any time, because whenever we got up, the attendants cleaned it, remaining tidy when we returned to it. Very good environment (I suggest the outdoor area). The buffet is absolutely adequate for what you expect from a five-star hotel breakfast. No disappointments, therefore. The price is a little high, but it can be characterized as fair, considering the cost / benefit.\n",
      "The place is very regional, a pleasant and cozy environment, great to go with family and friends. The service is excellent and the food is not even mentioned. I was in love with Filet a Parmegiana, the dish costs around 80 reais and serves up to 4 people. It is worth mentioning that all foods come very hot and also have regional dishes. I highly recommend this restaurant!\n",
      "Restaurant with a pleasant and picturesque atmosphere with cozy decor. The food is delicious. We liked the restaurant and the service so much that we came back to taste the delicious dishes of typical Minas cuisine. The braised cabbage with a bean tutu was wonderful. Don't forget to order the strawberry shake, it's worth a try ... !!!!\n",
      "Perfect food and service, prices that are worth it for the quality of the dishes. Generous portions that serve up to 3 people, not to mention that cachaça at the entrance, delicious and inviting aperitif.\n",
      "Until years ago I really liked Fon Pin's food, I went there because I thought I liked it ... today I went to the Goiânia Shopping pin, and the food was horrible .. Cold, the foods of old were really better .. .. Just an evaluation .. it will please everyone!\n",
      "Great! Intimate place, sensational service and, above all, food worthy of 5 stars! We thank Clécio for the great service !!\n",
      "want to make your day worthwhile with professional quality food you know this restaurant was great to have visited\n",
      "Good restaurant with a more traditional Chinese feel. I've been twice and I intend to go more. The attendants don't speak Portuguese very well, but the communication happens smoothly, I even managed to ask for recommendations! The shitake mushroom with pork is very tasty. I also ordered Mapo Tofu and it was delicious! The price is great too.\n",
      "Very good. Pizzas are delicious and one size fits all. Owners are friendly. Prices, like everything in Rio de Janeiro, are not so friendly. However, it is average for this type of restaurant. It is excellent that they do not deliver because they can maintain the quality (which is high). Today, for example, I came here to pick up my Pizzas for the trip and eat at home with the family.The only bad thing about the place is that when there are torrential rains the restaurant floods. It's worth visiting!\n",
      "Best Arab in Rio !! Traditional, eat at the counter !! Highlight for rice with lentils with onions on top and the traditional meat kafta !! Sensational!!\n",
      "A restaurant that is not worth seeing from the outside. It has a nice area in the back, like a beautiful old house. Very good food and good service. Good for cold days and without rain.\n",
      "I ordered an open sfiha of mozzarella with escarole, it was very tasty, it was about 5 reais and it came bigger than I expected !!\n",
      "As always, the cocoa show surprises by the quality of the chocolate, very different from the others ... but the prices are a little out of reality\n"

With impeccable service and new facilities and a very attentive staff, make this establishment a great option for those looking for a place to relax after the day's work, or just have a good meal in a more relaxed and cheerful environment! It's always worth checking out!\n",
      "I've been a regular at this great restaurant for over 35 years, when I got married and it was still located in Ermelindo Matarazzo. Since that time he already stood out with quality food and excellent service. Today it is located at Av São Miguel 4779 with super modern facilities and ample parking, which; it is almost always crowded. The food served remains of the highest quality with fair prices and the service is also excellent, especially the Garçon Mr Mathias, who is the oldest in the house. All dishes are excellent and well served; however, I would like to highlight the Filet a Cubana, which serves 4 people with ease. If you haven't tried it yet, do it next time and see what I'm saying. It is worth having lunch or dinner at Ótimo Chico Restaurante.\n",

      "I ate a very well served octopus at a very fair price. I tasted my boyfriend's tuna, it was great too. Sea bass ceviche at the entrance was suggested by our attendant Pedro, who by the way made our evening even more pleasant. The dessert (acerola mousse) was not very surprising. The dishes have a fair price, we only miss wines of more value in the menu. Worth the return.\n",

      "The stall of the lôro is super traditional in Salvador. It is on Flamengo beach, away from the most touristic neighborhoods like Ondina and Rio Vermelho, so if you are a tourist and use a taxi to go, prepare your pocket. The place is cool and lively. The menu has a good variety, and the price is okay.\n",

      "This is without a doubt the best restaurant in Natal. The food is delicious, very well served, the service is top 10 and they even have a free transfer from the hotel to the restaurant, round trip.We tried the Traditional Carne de Sol and the Northeastern Shrimp. Both are magnificent, I highly recommend!\n",

      "The Bodega do Sertão restaurant is a restaurant originally from Alagoas with standards in its decoration and food based in the Northeast, that is, with a large abundant quantity and variety of dishes that are served in the serl-f-service way, to be delighted in chairs made of wood or tree trunks, with the tablecloth in chintz fabric, and its walls and façade in taipei and, with a super shake, to complete the northeastern look it is really worth having dinner or lunch there.\n",
      "The food is certainly delicious! I recommend the Filet Surprise, which is a dish that serves 4 people peacefully. The restaurant is very simple and is located in a not too chic place, which is the Maletta Building. Great choice for those who are in the Center. They exchanged my companion's plate, but they soon sent it right. The price is high for the place, it's not that it's not worth it. I really liked it and recommend it.\n"

      "At the beginning, when it opened, we only had lunch at Cia do Churrasco. It was great. However, after a few months, the quality dropped absurdly, as did the service. Meats no longer as good as the previous ones and only a reasonable buffet made us give up and opt for other restaurants at Taguatinga Shopping.\n",

We were attended by different employees and from arrival to departure, everyone was very pleasant. You choose the intensity of the pepper in the dishes, varying from 1 to 4. I think that 2 is the most suitable. Pad Thai was great, one of the most important dishes in the house as we were told.\n",

Delicious skewers, however if you run away from the basic meat, chicken and sausage (R $ 4.90) you can pay up to R $ 10.90 for a skewer. The employees need to be a little bit more trained, they serve skewers in the dark and they don't say what it is, you have to ask, but they are very polite. I wish I could go more, the more I paid for 2 beers and 4 skewers, a bill of R $ 87.00 is more difficult !!\n",

      "Super nice and cozy restaurant, with a very varied menu and great service, has a dish so I highly recommend it !! the delicious shrimp gum. It's worth knowing.\n",
      "At least once a year we usually go to the restaurant but this time we are disappointed with the food. My duck rice was a bit greasy and my husband's ribs dish tasteless, but the worst was the entrance of manioc dumplings that were horrible. They should excel in taste and not in glamor. Atendimentp remains impeccable.\n",
      "This shop sells everything you need to build a house. It has varied prices. Modern, quality and tasteful furniture and fixtures.\n",
      "This restaurant escapes the kilo craze nowadays and prefers to opt for the assembly of dishes made. This manufacture tends to be balanced, beautiful and harmonious and, clearly, we perceive this concern with the image of the dish. Perhaps for that reason, prices are a little high. As for the quality I would say it is fair, it does not disappoint, but nothing special either.\n",
      "Spectacular food, cold beer, diverse beers like Coloradoe baden, very good service, highly recommended. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼\n",
      "Historic place in BH, in the Maletta Building. Pleasant atmosphere with tables in the internal and external areas. Good to go with friends, couples or family. The service is good and fast. The food is very well served and tasty. The price is very fair. I will be back for sure!\n",

      "I have been to La pasta Giala several times, and all with family members. Very pleasant for everyone.\n",
      "The bar is in the historic center of Curitiba and is very traditional in the city. It serves typical German food and the famous submarine, draft beer with a submerged Steinhäger mug that after consumption can be taken as a toast. The jaguar meat served there is also a delight! The atmosphere is rustic and very lively. You just need to be aware of the location, as the region is a little dangerous at night. Better to go with him.\n",
      "An excellent place to have a happy hour with friends. Delicious food, cold draft beer and good music.\n",
      "The draft beer is cold, the service is excellent, the feijoada dumpling is one of the best I've ever had in a bar. In addition to well frequented and well located.\n",
      "I went to the place only once, for a family lunch.I really liked the service, all the attendants were extremely helpful. I tried the tropeiro, I really liked the flavor and quantity offered.It is a place worth returning to at other times, at other times, as the environment also serves for a happy hour.\n",
      "Very cozy atmosphere, one of the best hamburgers I've ever eaten, fair price, On the day we went to the house it was very full, we had to wait an hour for a table.\n"

      "Very beautiful restaurant with excellent food. I recommend the exceptional veal stinco. I will be back other times is soon\n",
      "Excellent location, own free parking, high level service, fast and efficient. Pleasant atmosphere, air conditioned and decorated. The cost, although not cheap, is consistent with the standard, main courses ranging from 70 to 120 for 2 people. I had the opportunity to try a starter squid dinner, prawns with crab sauce as main and a thousand leaves with chocolate filling as a dessert, as well as a soursop juice jar (7.90 a jar), all simply impeccable and at a cost of R $ 169.00, already with service charge. There is cachaça at the door for tasting. Super busy restaurant for a Monday.\n",

      "I went to dinner at Divino Fogão one Saturday night. I thought the price of the kilo was exaggerated: 61.90 R $, there was very little variety of food. The food came completely cold, we had to ask to warm up in the microwave, after that the food was bad. I don't recommend it to anyone. I know many other kilo restaurants in the region that are much tastier at half the price.\n",
      "I really enjoyed the regional dishes served in the restaurant, among them dastaco the pirarucu de casaca. You can also find several types of tapioca, in addition to the delicious tacacá.\n",

      "Restaurant with excellent quality food, dishes with impeccable presentation and super service. I recommend the lasagna with truffles, from the same chef who signs the dishes of Ristorantino in SP .. The dessert of roll cake and lemon pie were also excellent! Very good family night!\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere and good service.Meats, side dishes and delicious desserts.I gave 4 stars just because I found the portion of my meat (filet mignon) small compared to the meat that my husband and our friends ordered! In addition our plate cooled quickly.But still, it's worth it!\n",
      "The shrimp patty as a starter is, indescribably, the best patty I have ever eaten. I have been several times and tried several dishes. All perfect! The shrimp stew is also delicious. In short: all the dishes are great. I love Comrade.\n",
      "As soon as you arrive at the site, you are immediately surprised by the fantastic architecture! The service is impeccable, especially the waiter José! The dishes and desserts are delicious! The price is a little steep, but it is worth it for the whole! I recommend it and I will be back every time I return to Natal.\n",
      "The food is very expensive. The dishes are individual and cost around 60 reais. It has few options for two or more people. But it is a different menu. Anyone who likes to pay dearly for good food can go there. The service is very good. Attentive and helpful waiters. Pleasant atmosphere with air conditioning.\n",
      "Typical food very well prepared and with a refined flavor.Very pleasant atmosphere and excellent service.\n",
      "I ate the dish called Shrimp International. I am told that it is one of the most popular. it's very good. Serves about 3 people who eat well. I had a sagatiba caipirinha that was very good too. I just found the service a little slow. We had a little trouble when we needed the waiter's assistance.\n",
      "Market food and pasta, waiters who don't know how to recommend wines, and dessert outside Italian standards\n",
      "Very good to take the family. Many toys for your child to have fun while you eat. The international shrimp is a good choice.\n",
      "It is a restaurant for foreigners, frequented by many foreigners, with a very varied menu and written in 3 languages. We ordered picanha on the stone. This dish has the advantage of the customer giving the desired point in the meat and is garnished with potatoes, 3 sauces, rice and salad. The garnishes were correct, but the meat kept turning around in my mouth and did not have a texture that resembled picanha or another cut of equivalent quality. Prices are fair.\n",
      "High standard Japanese cuisine!Delicate dishes, in flavor and presentation.Very attentive services that complement the practical menu system via tablet.Warm and friendly atmosphere.It is worth checking and revisiting\n",
      "One of the oldest and most traditional places to eat Chinese food in Brasilia, Restaurante China, located at 103 Sul, is in the middle of Asa Sul and has all the variations of Chinese food you can imagine. Very pleasant environment. And the candied banana is great too.\n",
      "I am not particularly a la carte, especially when it comes to steakhouse, I was in the Saanga once and did not return because of this.Regarding the quality, I have nothing to complain about, it goes well and the value is not absurd!\n",
      "The restaurant is large, has many tables, the service is excellent. Since the entrance in which the employee introduced the entire restaurant, explained how it works, showed the most typical foods, accommodated us at the table and gave a sample of the main juices in the house. The rennet cheese is very good with the manioc bread. Shrimp risotto was exceptional. Topper dessert is also good too. The only negative point of the restaurant is that it is far from Ponta Negra, but it is worth getting uber to go there to taste the dishes.\n",
      "We went to Dos Santos last Sunday, enjoying the restaurant week. We will definitely be back anytime. Very well thought out menu, the polenta and tartar were delicious. The same can be said of pasta and fish with 3 purées (beetroot, pumpkin and lemon. All the very attentive waiters providing a relaxed yet very efficient and attentive service (even a kitchen trick taught us). week restaurant is worth knowing\n",
      "Hard meat, lousy shrimp and extortionate prices. For tourists. Munchies under the table biting. I won't be returning.\n",
      "Mc Donald's standard, nothing new, service and product offered at any other establishment in the chain. Good location in the Rio Vermelho neighborhood, close to the Bompreço Supermarket, fast service.\n",
      "We came to the restaurant by chance. It is on the second floor.A buffet of fresh and delicious food.The place is simple. Tables and chairs like that of a dining room. But clean, cozy. With a nice selection at the buffet\n",
      "Great restaurant recently opened in downtown São Paulo. Simple and cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, has a reduced menu, very well prepared. A good choice is the well-served and harmonious salad of green leaves, poached pear and saint paulin cheese. I tried the confard de canard with mashed mandioquinha in truffled butter, molasses and black rice, very tasty. The sweet rice with baba de moça is also very good. The price is right, I believe that the cost / benefit of Balbina is above the other few good restaurants in the city center. I left the restaurant fully satisfied, I intend to return soon to try the executive menu, which also looks very attractive.\n",
      "The panoramic view of Jardim de Alah Beach is very good. The service is reasonable and leaves something to be desired. If the waiters were more concerned with the customer it would be more recommendable.\n",
      "Excellent service from dear Marcos and Wagner, as always the priceless international prawn and clarinei could not miss the soft cocada.\n"

      "I was there at the invitation twice. On these occasions I found the prices to be very high for the restaurant category and the quality of the dishes was only reasonable. The great attraction, the view to the city, was never possible on any occasion, having then the view of a common and very expensive restaurant,\n",
      "For those who will stay for a short time in the city and want to make the most of local cuisine, this restaurant is ideal. Because it is self-service, you can experience more than if it were à la carte. It has little variety of desserts, but it has a small shop where you can buy souvenirs and cachaça. Ticket voucher accepted.\n",
      "I made a point of going to this restaurant on the recommendation of 2 colleagues from Pará. Very good varied food - congratulations to the chef- at home with rustic decor. My table was in the air-conditioned environment (I suggest a lot), but with a view of the river. Buffet + juice- R $ 65.00- good investment!

      "I came on Safari because of the reviews here on Tripadvisor and I was not disappointed. Great burger, perfect atmosphere. It has varied options on the menu, even if you don't want to eat hamburger. It is not the cheapest sandwich in town, but the quality justifies the amount paid. It now remains to return to prove the other options.\n",
      "We went to the restaurant that is close to Pontal and I didn't like the place, far from the waterfront, unattractive place. The food was good, but nothing extraordinary.\n",
      "Good service, be sure to try some of the special beers from Amazon beer. The menu offers peculiar dishes, such as wild heart of palm, worth a try.\n",

      "Steakhouse should be a place of joy.So imagine how bad a steakhouse has to be to frustrate the same customer over and over over the years. Except for meats, the food is sour.But what made me decide that I would not return to Master Grill was the recurrence of pettiness episodes:- Once they made a friend pay the price only meat because they thought there was a lot of barbecue on top of beans and rice;- On another occasion, they refused to correct an absurd value in the command, claiming that I should have noticed at the time of weighing.Stay away from this place. Note that I'm not the only one to rate it with a star.\n",

      "It is a great cost benefit for self service lunch. In addition to having a show on Thursday nights with country music bands, forró. It's really worth it. On Saturdays in the afternoon until 9 pm there is also a forró and sertanejo show. Excited.\n",
      "I love Xcup da Silva, all the dishes are delicious and the atmosphere is very pleasant. The pizzas are sooo good, thin dough the way I like it. My favorite is grandma's pizza (jambú with pink shrimp). The only problem is the queue, which is usually quite long.\n",
      "Simply wonderful, very cozy and organized place, delicious dishes, exceptional service, very beautiful environment, well lit and perfect decoration, very sophisticated.\n",
      "The house could be great if I was careful with the customers, but my experience and that of the friends who were with me were bad. There was a lack of everything in the kitchen and the bar (pitu, glass, ice bucket), the orders for food did not arrive at the table, and after much insisting more than three times on the arrival of the orders, we knew that they had not been registered.The purchase and payment had to be launched on the spot and the customer had to wait in a huge line at the bar counter, which could be facilitated if there was a command organization card and more people to attend.They stopped selling much more, for sure, and lost some of the potential customers who really enjoyed the band, which was the only thing that pleased and was worth it!\n",
      "I tried to make a reservation for Valentine's Day, but even calling (only gave voicemail) or sending an email (nobody answered until today), we decided to meet anyway and I was disappointed. The environment is what saves the house, very comfortable and at the back there is a very cozy area next to the bathrooms. Incidentally terrible care with the men's bathroom, because they had papers thrown on the floor and without shampoo! When ordering the dish of good memories on the menu, I did not receive any souvenirs at the end of the dinner, because it was only afterwards that I was informed that they are no longer part of the Good Memories Association, that is, I felt cheated, the main reason for my discontent. My wife's temaki came with soft seaweed and I didn't like the type of ceviche cut, it looked like it was made by an amateur. The shrimp was reasonable, since the pineapple juice with mint, tasted strange, it was impossible to eat and the banana dessert with ice cream could be better prepared. It had a free buffet option, but we opted for a la carte because we found it very expensive compared to other restaurants in the region and even so the bill was salty for two people.\n"

The best piamontese rice in the world !!! Sophisticated atmosphere, air-conditioned, cheap dishes, attentive staff, fast service. It makes me want to move to Aracaju rs. It has already become a mandatory stop.\n",
      "The restaurant is average, food is average, it takes too long for the dishes to arrive and the question of hygiene and kindness are not strong. When I went, a waiter had a runny nose with a runny nose that he wiped and finished taking our order. Of course, he didn't wash his hands before serving us food. The value is not the cheapest, but despite all this the look of the place is indescribable. From the top of a hill you see coconut trees and the green marzão that enchants everyone who knows the beaches in Alagoas. Access and the surrounding community do not inspire much security, but what would life be like if it weren't for emotions? I come back whenever I need to take someone who doesn't know the place, but it's not my first choice for meals.\n",

      "I found it expensive for what they serve. Service leaves something to be desired.The pastries are delicious, but nothing out of the ordinary.

      "For me the best alaminuta buffet in Porto Alegre. The food is excellent, good salad options, quality alaminuta and they mix the service of the buffet with service at the tables too, replacing steak and potatoes as many times as necessary.

      "Simple hotel, executive standard accommodation, without luxury, but with an excellent location! Excellent service provision! Worth the cost / benefit for a quick trip.\n",
      "We took a lot of acai, all very good, clean and very pleasant place, with attendants well disposed to good service.\n",
      "Buffet food bad and ugly place. We don't like it.It is worth the assistance, which, like most of the locations inMaceió, it's very good.\n",
      "I made a reservation for 22:30, 22:45, I received the information that the kitchen was closing. Detail: the website contains (va) information that the establishment closes at 00:00. The service was very confusing and fickle, for example, I didn't want to bring certain dishes because it took too long to be done in the words of the waiter, who was always apologizing for his mistakes but seemed unconcerned.The worst was when it was time to leave when they said I would have to ask for the bill (it wasn't even 0:00) and then they threw a dirty napkin in my drink that was half full!Another 5 minutes and, of course, they asked me to leave the house.Even complaining they only apologized and left it at that! (This is logical after the account and 10% paid)As for the food it was good, nothing extraordinary, it does not stand out among the various Peruvians in the city, and as I said, the choice of dishes was limited by the haste of the employees to leave. Hot starters were out of the question, for example ...Anyway, it doesn't pay to go back to a place like this for free. Pay to be treated badly and later expelled from an establishment where reservation was made.\n",
      "Family atmosphere, suitable for work meetings, celebrations and leisure. It has an air-conditioned area, televisions, children's area and option for carvery, pizza and salad.\n",

      "The only bad thing about this pastry shop is not being able to eat everything! Lol All products are very tasty, for those who love brownie or sweets in general, this is the right place. The service from the staff is excellent! Prices are good and sometimes they launch some interesting promotions!\n",
      "Excellent service, cordial, friendly and accurate. The food was delicious, the wine well served. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Living up to its fame, Rotisseria Sírio Libanesa serves the best Arabian snacks that I know in Rio de Janeiro.Highlight for the meat kibe and the meat and vegetable sfihas. They also serve a delicious mate, always very cold.For those who want there are also meals, but the restaurant environment is small, with few seats and always very crowded. Only once were we in the mood for a meal and managed to sit down. The food is delicious, but the rice and cabbage rolls were not as impressive as the savory ones. The kafta is also very tasty!The house works with a debit card, but does not accept credit cards.\n",

      "Delicious! I love the vegetarian hamburger, I'm addicted to it! The pesto pasta with fish is also sensational! To complete a breathtaking view of the city.\n",
      "I went with my family to visit the place and eat the sushi, in a day, not very crowded, and the service was terrible, the sushi passed once in a lifetime and once in death in ours, and when we had the opportunity to eat the hot sushi was cold, and there was only rice, p to find fish, shrimp, kani or whatever the sushi is, I didn't think so! We were in 4 people, we left 120 reais in the restaurant p to have no return, if we ate 10 sushi each person was a lot and p who goes in rodizios know that this is not anyone's goal! Unfortunate! As my complaint will not return my money back, I want to make people aware of not going to this place anymore, they will lose money, time and they will still be hungry, because they will not be able to stand eating this terrible sushi\n",
      "Very nice family lunch! Well served and tasty dishes, several wine options with honest prices and a very kind and attentive service by the waiter Willian. Options also for children. We recommend !!\n",
      "A refined location, reasonable price. I didn't particularly like my dish (shrimp risotto), it was tasteless and the rice was not evenly cooked, there were still some tough ones, my friend ordered the shrimp stew, but it looked like green pepper stew, which stole all the flavor from the dish.\n",

      "Restaurant with several options of pasta and pizza mainly. Very pleasant and sophisticated environment. Great option for dinner.\n",
      "i bought a wonderful margarita and pepperoni pizza, i'm from sao paulo in no doubt we have a pizza like this ... and price for being in copacabana and without comparison.\n",
      "The flavors of Thai dishes are unique. Even that dish that you think you know, in Thai is different, and much better and tastier. There are culinary mergers that you won't find anywhere else. It's just too much!\n",

      "I was at the restaurant at the end of July / 2016 for lunch.Very pleasant atmosphere, with piped music, spectacular service (especially the maitre d 'and Horion) and delicious food!The restaurant has meat as its flagship and does not disappoint. Excellent quality!The environment is refrigerated and has its own free parking.I recommend.\n",
      "The tent is from a very young boy, who likes to surf and is there 24 hours a day, the simplest of the 3 in this region, but they are more efficientThe tent is from youth to youth, simple as that, I'm over 50, but I'm young.Maybe the only one that doesn't make any artificial sounds from the whole beach. Even though, don't put it kkkk, says that the sound of the sea is enoughIt's too quiet and you feel at homeSo much so that we went back to the tent two more times!I really recommend it!We eat red with painWe really like Pirão, and tropeiro beans ...High level serviceWe will be back in the next vacation\n"

Cone just ok. We drank beer: bohemia came mega cold! Main course: fish stew and shrimp. Delicious! Anyway, super recommend! I left there happy! I missed one of my favorite restaurants, Siri Mole, whose chef is in Gabriela's flavors!\n",

      "Very good snack bar for those who just want a quick snack. Sandwiches with a wide variety of flavors. Very good natural juices. Price a little salty, but it is worth enjoying a good snack!\n",
      "When it comes to that name, we create a certain expectation. The staff is very well trained, but the food itself is very simple. Perhaps the pasta is what is most worthwhile in the house. We ordered a fillet with wine that was salty and a mashed potato that can't be wrong. The gnhocci was good and a chicken with peas that were withered. Anyway, there's nothing much, the tiramisu dessert was very good. Maybe the kitchen at the mall. I have limitations, I don't know.\n",

      "Restaurant with a very good quality buffet service. Very pleasant atmosphere and very well decorated. Very good service. Fair price.\n",
      "We pay 50.00 reais in a rotation that is not even these things. The pork ribs with barbecue sauce is not good. Entries offered in the carvery take too long to pass at the table. For the price that is charged on things, it would have to be a little more sophisticated. You pay dearly and it's not worth it! I won't be back and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone!\n",

And for dessert the crunchy chocolate pie with ice cream and cherry sauce, which was delicious !! To complete the drink, the pisco is very good! Service note ten !!I recommend it and if we return to Maceió, we will return !! The price is a little steep but it's worth it!\n",
      "Skewers with various options and tastes, very cold beer (with fair price) and football on TV every Wednesday and Thursday.

Very good, I recommend !!!\n",

      "This establishment I really could not fail to evaluate, after all my son's birthday became an unpleasant and boring night. I make it clear that the waiters are attentive, I have nothing to criticize from these professionals, as they served my table right.On 05/08/2017, I called, among other Pizzerias, at Pizza César da 404 sul, my intention was to choose one with good price and quality so that we could celebrate the birthday of my 13 year old son, on 05/09/2017 . I was preceded by Mrs. Jose, who gave me the following values: Rodízio: R $ 29.90 and Soda Refill: R $ 8.90, and thinking about the cost benefit and quality of the service (since it is a well-known pizzeria), I closed the reservation for 09/05/2017, at 19h, in individual commands for 20 people and forwarded it to all the guests by message (it is worth saying that Ms. Jose called me on the 9th to confirm the reservation and values).To my disappointment and annoyance, on the day of the celebration, my father asked the waiter for the menu, which, when he handed it over, told him that Rodízio was R $ 33.90. I asked him to speak to the manager, as I had made the reservation and the price Jose gave me had been different, but he returned saying that there would be no way, the Price of the Rodízio would be R $ 33.90.Therefore, I got up and went to talk to the MANAGER who introduced himself to me as CRISTIANO, explained that I had made the reservation on the 8th and confirmed on the 9th with Mrs. Jose, that she had passed me the amount of R $ 29, 00 by the rotation and that at the time of the party the waiter informed that it was R $ 33.90, Mr. Cristiano's reply was that the employee had made a mistake and that he could do nothing (this manager is out of the ordinary rudeness , I had never met a manager so arrogant, arrogant, clueless, rude and tactless to give him to clients). Once again I explained the situation that she had passed me the price of R $ 29.90 and I pointed out that she had sent a message with this amount to all the guests the previous day, including that my son's schoolmates would go and that I there was no way to change what I had already said at the time of the event. Mr. Manager Cristiano, in a very rude way, interrupted me saying that IF I HAD THE RIGHT TO TALK HE ALSO HAD BECAUSE HE WAS THERE TO WORK AND COULD NOT DO ANYTHING IF THE PRICE THAT WAS PASSED WAS WRONG, THAT I WHO SHOULD HAVE GOT IT WRONG AND THAT THIS AMOUNT OF R $ 29.90 WAS THE AMOUNT CHARGED ON MONDAY AND NOT ON TUESDAY ... after hearing the Manager's impudent justifications, I limited myself to saying that okay, that I would pay the difference for the guests and I would place the restaurant in justice, AT THIS MOMENT HE SAID THAT IT WILL CHARGE THE AMOUNT THAT WAS PASSED TO ME, BUT FOR I TO THINK WELL BECAUSE THE AMOUNT WILL BE DISCOUNTED FROM THE EMPLOYEES WHO PASSED ME THE WRONG AMOUNT.Guys, what a challenge !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In other words, would it be fair for me to pay for their mistake? Anyway, I went back to the table after this unpleasant conversation and tried to welcome my son's guests well, because I couldn't eat any more a piece of pizza, the night lost its grace for me.Due to the fact that I am an individual commander, several people paid and left before us (me and my son), leaving in the end a group of 5 people ... My son's godfather was leaving and I asked to see his account, I found that he had paid 4 casters in the amount of R $ 33.90, I was very upset and when talking to the cashier girl she said that it had only happened on that account (I did not have access to the account of the other guests). Once again, I complained to the manager manager, who gave me some upset answers, sent my son's godfather R $ 12.00 (difference amount) and charged him R $ 29.00 for the last 4 that were left.In order not to get bored anymore, I preferred to shut up and leave, but when I was at the door he asked for the birthday boy's ID, I took my minor son's identity card out of the bag and he took it from my hand to photograph ... I thought that was strange, I asked because I needed to take a picture, I was already ready with the whole situation. Without much explanation and very rudely he replied that it was the procedure of the house (all right, but it shouldn't have been asked by the time we arrived? I needed to take a photo of a minor's document? I didn't like it! To check the date, but expose my son after all this situation ...)In view of my questioning regarding the photo of my son's document, he once again told me that he was in his work environment and that it was like that, that he had the right to say what he thought and did not have to keep giving explanation, that was the procedure of the house. At this point I was already disgusted with so much lack of respect and I told SR. CRISTIANO MANAGER that he was an unprofessional manager, that his job was to solve problems and unforeseen problems with customers and not cause and seek confusion with them, I also said that my desire was to bring the restaurant to justice for damages and annoyances suffering and frustration caused to my son that night and ... PASMEMMMMMMM, his answer to me was that he could sue me for saying this to him in his work environment.Anywaymmmmmmmmmmm, I saw that there are other comments regarding the price here on the website, so I note that the problem is not only this, much more serious is the lack of respect, commitment and commitment to customers, the lack of professionalism of the people there are huge, qualification for the position is not only what is on the employee's resume !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (The tip is left to the home owner.DO NOT RECOMMEND, BAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE FRUSTRATION WE HAD WASN'T WORTH THE PRICE WE PAID!\n"

      "Excellent restaurant with easy access in São Paulo.An unavoidable option is the Bisteca (which looks a lot like the Fiorentine steak and, as it comes, it is very red). If you don't like red meat, order it well done. The rare is practically sealed, only. (Which I highly recommend)The plate is large and can be divided for two people. The price is quite cheap (compared to the benefit of the meat and being in São Paulo).The onion with bread is also quite good.The beer comes very cold and there are plenty of options. I recommend Serra Malte, which is fuller and is not easy to find.\n",
      "A great option in Eataly. I was there on Sunday and the experience was very good from start to finish. Although crowded, the wait is very well organized and after 30 minutes we received an SMS warning about the availability of our table. Time is not felt as we can move around the floor until called. The dishes were excellent, the pasta came at the right point and was very tasty. Prices are fair, it's worth knowing.\n",

      "My husband and I went through a promotion of carvery that we bought in urban fish. Despite this, when we arrived at the place we were very well received, with no inferior service because it was something of collective purchase. In addition to an excellent service, we had access to several types of delicious meats and we also had the option of serving ourselves in a buffet that was exposed in a self-boiling format and that had everything from rice to sushi. We love the place and intend to return at other times!\n",

      "Enjoying a Japanese restaurant is a mixture of art, tradition and taste. That is why so few become a temple to enjoy oriental cuisine.This restaurant is certainly honest but it is far from providing an unforgettable experience.Excellent sushi depends on very fresh fish (and it was) and also on perfect rice (not the case).Honest but nonchalant service.I keep looking for the real temples ....\n",

For those looking for less sophistication and more practicality and more affordable price, I don't consider it a good place. Just to go once to really know.\n",

      "Traditional place, mandatory to visit in Aracaju, it is at the same time a bar / restaurant with an attached concert hall (only Forró !!). Good for eating typical dishes, especially seafood. The moqueca catado de crab is the champion dish. The owner, Mr. Hamilton, is always there looking around at everything, guiding the employees in the restaurant / bar and later, takes a shower, changes clothes and runs the venue. All decor, very picturesque, typical with things from the region he says he chose or had done. Very interesting, the local people also frequent well and share space with tourists from everywhere.

      "an environment with retro decor and many antiques. Excellent music and well attended ... the queue is huge, get ready!\n",
      "We ate there two days in a row. The food is excellent. On the first day, we tasted the coalho cheese with herbs that comes with garlic bread, excellent. In the second, the dessert was awesome! Banana pastry with tapioca ice cream and tangerine sauce!\n",
      "Excellent restaurant, especially northeastern food, for those who like a lot of food this is the place. My suggestion is Picanha Completa, it is very worthwhile.\n",
      "I came to have dinner with my family here, and I was extremely unhappy to see the bathroom all puked. I told the waiter 3x. throughout my stay, more than 1 hour on site did not clean! I was told to go to another bathroom in the hotel reception. I was shocked! If there's no cleaning in the bathroom, I don't even want to think about the rest.Regarding the service, very reasonable to bad. Inattentive waiters, tables that towels were not clean.Regarding the food, it was ok. Dishes well served, but would not recommend due to lack of hygiene and cleanliness on site.\n",
      "This cabin by the sea is a perfect place to enjoy a day at the beach. Perfect food and snack to accompany a cold beer with live DJ. The price is not very inviting, but it is worth it.\n",
      "The place is super nice and stylish. Super beautiful decor. I watched a show.Now the price is quite salty, but it is worth it.Whoever intends to go to the Gallery, be sure to take the camera to the bathroom, it's beautiful and you can take several photos.\n",
      "My family and I usually visit weekly. The menu is lean, which favors the restaurant, which maintains the good standard in their preparation. Agile and efficient service. I could open the mezzanine at lunchtime, as the few internal tables are crowded and the outside area is uncomfortable, due to the incidence of the sun and the consequent heat.\n",
      "In addition to the ambience, the service is very good, I just thought the food was a little lower than expected, not that it's bad, quite the contrary, but the hamburger for example is not so much better than its competitors to have a price twice as expensive , does not justify such a difference.\n",
      "Close to the Vila Prudente Metro station, you can find good meals, snacks, juices and drinks always at hand and with great service. The staff of Twoonay (as the place is also known) are always willing to serve good food well. My suggestion is the delicious orange juice and the piranha meal, always well prepared and at a great price.\n",
      "I asked for a promotion plate that was double and as we couldn't eat all they said we couldn't take the rest because it was from the promotion. What does it have to do? I had to ask for the bowl and put it myself.\n",
      "The best restaurant of northeastern food. The only danger is that there are so many options, it makes you want to eat a little bit, and when you see the dish it’s too full lolDelicious food, good service (it gets worse when it is very full).Tip: the sweet bread with coconut cover that sells at the bakery.\n",
      "Simple place for late night. Without comfort, it only has outside tables, the relaxed atmosphere, it is good to cure hangover, the panelada and the bean soup I recommend without fear !!\n",
      "Very good service, varied menu, wonderful look. I recommend visiting the place in the summer because in the cold it is almost impossible to enjoy the view because of the wind.\n",
      "It was my best choice in the city of Campo Grande !!!Above average Oriental restaurant, with a wide variety of dishes and drinks, excellent service and agility. The menu is completely different, an excellent place for family, friends and company gatherings.\n",
      "What about a Sergio Arno House ?!Simply Fantastic !!!The delicious dishes, besides being tasty, are very well presented and well served !!Very nice place and perfect service !!\n",
      "I use the establishment a lot. I really like lunch, convenience, bread (although not the best in town!). But I am beginning to realize that the service depends a lot on the mood of the employees on the day and, REGRETELY, cleaning is flawed. The floor is constantly dirty, tables and chairs too; finally the spell is breaking. You can't just remove used dishes from tables, you need to clean them !!!It is already the fourth time in a row; today I decided to register!\n",
      "Pizzas served on a rotating basis !!! Excellent quality and service !!! And you even have the option to include the salad buffet in the package !!!\n",
      "I was at the dinner on February 1st at the Sanctuarium. As it is the day before Yemanjá, the tasting menu was composed of dishes with African influence. Very tasty, filled with spices, balanced and harmonized with drinks - sparkling wine and digestive. Despite the price, it is worth the visit! Great!\n"

      "The best restaurant within the self-service proposal. The variety is great added to some items that are not usually found in other environments. The price, however, is a little scary.\n",
      "I like the foods that are not fried. I find it healthier. I'll have my baby's party at Habibs.\n",
      "The place (thanks unit) is extremely nice and cozy. Service is good and orders arrive within a reasonable time.They offer gloves so that pizzas can be enjoyed by hand. For the price paid, it is worth escaping from traditional flavors. I recommend the mackerel salmon, the grilled fillet and gorgonzola with pepper sauce.The pizzeria usually offers weekly promotions linked to the new delivery. However, I found the final price to be salty, even when ordering the pizza from the promotion, which tends to be a traditional flavor: in addition to delivery, which has a high price, since the neighborhood is nearby, they also charge for the packaging. In addition, if you pay on credit, you pay in advance by providing the security code (!)\n",
      "I liked the location, the service and the food was tasty, although nothing exceptional. For the price I found the portion small. Incidentally, in defense of the restaurant, it is said that for some time in Brasilia the portions have been decreasing everywhere, as prices increase ...\n",
      "In short ........, the best esfiha in Campo Grande !!!!! When you come to Campo Grande, or even, you who live in the city of and never visited, I recommend !!!!\n",

      "Well decorated place with excellent options of dips, starters and burgers.I ordered the Hamburger Perdigueira, it was very well seasoned and not at all nauseating.The incoming cassava was well cooked and crispy on the outside.It is an excellent option in Curitiba. I recommend!!!\n",
      "Fair price, very good service. Few options for pizzas in the carvery, are not so stuffed. I would say that you can try the place. Mondays and Thursdays there is forró, but we didn't go these days.\n",
      "In addition to the convenience of being inside the mall, the atmosphere, food and service are worth the visit. On Saturdays there is the festival of paella and cod with dishes at discounted prices. The service is very attentive. The dishes are tasty and well served. I recommend.\n",
      "It is not the first time that I go to Djapa, whenever I am more and more surprised. First let's talk about the staff, all very attentive and polite, Miguel, the owner partner goes to all the tables to talk to customers and see if they are being well attended.Now regarding the food served, everything is good and the best. A wide variety of fish and seafood pleases everyone's taste. You use yourself at will.The atmosphere is super cool, excellent to go with family, friends and make several celebrations.\n",
      "In addition to a vast buffet and food is very tasty. The options are so many that I, who am a vegetarian, didn't even complement the plate with cheese.Macaxeira very well made, lentils, chickpeas and several other delicious options.Recommended!\n",
      "A pleasant surprise! ❤ I placed an order on the menu that was at Hotel Granada in Lapa and when I arrived I found out it was from Bar do Adão. The pastel is sensational! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I am delighted with the shrimp pastry. I tried the shrimp pastry, dried meat and meat. All good! I ordered a shrimp hideaway and it is to be eaten praying. There was shrimp. Friendly service. I intend to go back and introduce the place to other people.\n",
      "Carioca who is Carioca has eaten at least once in this juice store, which, in addition to preparing wonderful and fresh juices to the taste of the customer, has healthy and fast snacks on the menu, such as crepe (spinach with ricotta and walnuts is a thousand) , sandwiches, omelets and snacks not so light but unmissable, like the ovomaltine milkshake\n",
      "Inside the Rio Poty shopping mall, this beer bar has a limited beer menu. When I saw the menu I was even happy, because I really appreciate dark chop, which after all is a rare thing here in this place, but ... logically ... there was no\n",
      "Excellent service and menu. The meat was on point and very tasty. The price is a little high\n",
      "The environment is very beautiful and has an indoor and outdoor area, the food is very good, what is lacking is the service.\n",
      "Very good dishes with precise flavor combinations. Intimate and pleasant atmosphere. Fair price! Recommend with eyes closed\n",
      "Delicious draft beer, lots of food options, interesting atmosphere and very good service. I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a choice for large or small groups.\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere and well located in Dias Ferreira! Great food! Service always a little highlighted. Well recommended!\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, good service, extremely tasty food, very well selected playlist. great!\n",
      "I always passed in front of the restaurant and wanted to stop and try it.The restaurant is not very busy and that may have contributed to why I didn't think it would be a good option.I decided to try the promotional dish that (I think it was cod in the spring) and surprised me! I already made cod at home and I know it is expensive to prepare this dish, especially if it is quality cod, as it is at Cia do Peixe.The fish was very tasty and there were two tenderloin fillets well served, with a great accompaniment of vegetables.Definitely a great cost benefit for those who want to eat cod in Campo Grande. I went with my wife and we left very satisfied, and there was still fish left because it was very well served. We took home the marmitinha !!!The atmosphere is very familiar and the service is rated 10. Simple and functional.I definitely recommend it and I'm going back with family and friends to try the codfish rodízio.\n",
      "It was fun, excellent food and service and saved me from a much bigger problem than it seems. PAS\n",
      "We ordered Cannelloni Santa Maria. The presentation is great but the cheese is very salty inside the cannelloni. Very pleasant atmosphere and great service. We may not have been right in choosing the dish.\n",
      "excellent restaurant for everyone: from kids who love pizza, to lovers of cold draft beer. almost always with live music in the outdoor area and excellent pizza rodizio in the indoor area\n",
      "The restaurant is simple, but, they say, it has the best sun meat in Piauí. Really the carne de sol is first rate and worth a try. It is close to the main entrance of the State University of Piauí.\n",
      "Bad service, they don't explain anything, cold service, besides the waiting line.A pity because the lamen is good.\n",
      "As a starter, order the garlic bread and eggplant. The pasta with shrimp and truffles and the flagship. It can be shared for two people.\n",
      "I remember when there was only 1 Madero restaurant in Curitiba, there are now more than 10!The service is always good and the atmosphere is great. I think the trees planted inside the restaurant are really cool.My favorite is the Cheeseburger. The desserts are very good too, I almost always ask for the brigadeiro pancake.\n",
      "Great atmosphere, food, service, musicIt was a very pleasant eveningItalo's service was very good\n",
      "Excellent cuisine and good service. The cod and fish are of the highest quality and the codfish cake is the best in town.I also liked the wine listGiovani.\n",
      "Great pizza and reasonably priced. The place has no space for children where I think it is bad since I have a small daughter and we always go with her friends and it really gets complicated.Very pleasant place with a varied wine list.\n",
      "We were at the place on a Wednesday and, although we were not late, the Japanese food buffet served one person and some of the most sought after items were missing. We asked if there would be a replacement and they told us that no and that if we wanted something from the kitchen, we should order it right away because they were going to finish the orders. Is this possible in POA before 11 pm? I imagined that living in the capital had advantages!\n",
      "We were attended by Garson Anderson Pestana, great service, attentive and very helpful .....\n",
      "The dishes are delicious, the waiters serve well, good variety on the menu, a sophisticated place, but it is a restaurant-bar. plays matches and fights and stays open late.\n"

      "I went to the Ecological Restaurant 4 times, the place and a farm a little far from the center, but super busy, all rustic raw wood, large tables, wood stove, with lots of food, all kinds of typical food from the region, at a very affordable price .\n",
      "I found the food excellent. The dishes are well served and sometimes eat up to 3 people. We were met by a waiter named Brad. Very attentive, agile and super attentive. Beautiful location and kind staff. Indicate the restaurant\n",
      "Exotic food, now with air conditioning makes the environment pleasant. I tried alligator meat and recommend it.\n",
      "environment with live music full dishes that serve a family well, the service can be time consuming on busy days. any shrimp dish is worth the visit.\n",
      "I have already been to Cervantes located on Avenida das Americas, in Barra, RJ. I had the pleasure of eating, for a few times, the filet mignon sandwich with pineapple pate and I can say that there is no better sandwich !! It is VERY worth eating at this restaurant! IF you are, ask for this sandwich and you will not regret it !!!\n",
      "Terrible attendance! We ordered a pizza and after asking to cancel it, in less than three minutes from the first order, we were stopped by the attendant, who, attending to other people at the same time, told us that this would not be possible to do, since the previous day there was already 90 reais was deducted from his salary due to a pizza cancellation. So, after arguing and having been informed by the same attendant that we should be more attentive, we were forced to order and eat that pizza. Unbelievable! In the heart of São Paulo, acting like this with the public.\n",
      "I had already been to Cameroon 3 years ago and I can say that they did not fall and the standard of service, food, comfort and refinement did not fall ... starter, main course and dessert very well served, excellent service, pleasant space ... worth waiting on the waiting list ...\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, warm welcome, delicious food, staff are to be congratulated for their friendliness and dancing 😊\n",
      "For those who want a great meal, here is a place I recommend. A great structure, tasty food and in a very accessible place! Worth it!\n",
      "A friend introduced me to 4Beer as soon as I arrived in POA and immediately fell in love. The draft beer is amazing (there is beer for all tastes), the service is great and the owners are super cool! I frequent since the beginning, I became a fan and always give a stop to that different draft beer and a side dish, which is worth trying. If you come for a walk or work in the city, be sure to visit 4Beer (especially if you love beers!)! You will not regret!\n",
      "The Aclimação neighborhood is well known for establishments specializing in skewers, and I know at least 7 such establishments in the region.Pedra Azul, in my opinion, is one of the best.The service is usually good, and the skewers are delicious and have a wide variety. The value is on average or even slightly below, compared with other options in the region. At least it used to be, since I haven't been back in a few months.Anyway, when the destination is Aclimação, my preference is usually this place.\n",
      "We went out to dinner and everything went well. The atmosphere was super nice, cozy and calm. The service was prepared and efficient. And the food was not long in coming and it came out super delicious. I recommend it to everyone and will be back. Really enjoyed.\n",

      "I went once alone, after finding directions on the internet. I liked it so much that I came back with my family! Everyone liked it a lot and even today, when we talk about Japanese food, Tanka is the first reference .... The food is delicious, the atmosphere is very good and the service is good too!It's super worth it !!!\n",
      "I really enjoyed the food. I tried Pato with Tucupi and found it sensational, in addition to the very good draft beer that was served.\n",
      "delicious crepe, good music, well located, lots of beautiful people, and I recommend it to everyone, but there is only skol beer.\n",
      "I discovered Tokkuri through TripAdvisor, very well rated and rightly so. The sushi man are very competent, quality fish and kind service. It's worth it, a restaurant to look for quality, not quantity. The blades of raw fish seasoned with lemon are divine.\n",
      "It's like an Outback Steakhouse, only a lot cooler. The decor is based on rock'n'roll (highlighted by the guitars on the walls and the stairs leading to the upper floor). Cheap draft beer at happy hour (6 pm - 8 pm Monday to Friday), great snacks and always a good live show. Friendly service.\n",
      "We made a reservation for 21:00, I understand that we arrived ten minutes late, but we went to the counter and asked if anyone who had a reservation needed to take the queue or enter directly, and they told us to take the queue. After an hour of waiting, we arrived at the counter and informed the receptionist about the reservation, and she informed us that they only hold the reservation until 9:00 pm. So why didn't they tell us when we went to ask? It would save us time and stress. Not to mention the terrible service from the receptionist, she speaks screaming and with the face of someone who is there because she was obliged !!! Bad, next time, I will think a thousand times before I go to that place! Total lack of respect and consideration for the customer.\n",

      "Very good sashimis, sushi and temakis.However, in the a la carte service, it took a long time.Offers buffet service,\n",
      "We don't have dinner here. We came to drink and listen to music. We got here live music had been canceled. We ordered two different drinks on the menu, and the surprise! Drips 51 pure, it is only colored ..Cold beer. But the drinks 😞😞\n",
      "Local with great cuts of meat, one of the best in BH. Meats are prepared in front of customers. It has a good beer list. The space is a little tight for a restaurant so sought after.\n",
      "For those looking for a different place to have a Happy Hour, you need to visit Mandibula. In a small environment with industrial decor, the bar mixes indie music, vinyls and beers, but Gin Tônica de la is considered the best in SP!\n",
      "great service, wonderful food and beautiful and sophisticated structure! worth a dinner / lunch on site\n",
      "Excellent option of pleasant atmosphere and wonderful food with acceptable prices. Always good to try to book because the bistro is sold out on weekends. It is worth it !!!!\n",
      "I recommend to have beer and make small talk. It always lives full and is well attended. The snack menu is very varied and the portions do not disappoint in quantity and price. But for me the best option, without a doubt, is the quieber portion. I've never eaten better.\n",
      "With a good location, Recoleta has a steak house proposal. Different and tasty cuts the restaurant / bar is worth the visit. The service still needs to be improved, the home environment and comfortable with options of tables in the outdoor and indoor areas.\n",
      "Restaurant that meets the expectations for those who want to eat a good Peruvian dish. The atmosphere is simple but cozy. The chief runs the house and has a unique sympathy. I recommend the visit.\n",
      "I returned to Casa do Peixe after some years and realized that the level dropped a little. We opted for carvery and most of the fish were fried or grilled and soaked in fat. The buffet that accompanies the carvery could have a wider offer of cold dishes and salads. Perhaps the next à la carte choice.\n"

      "Yesterday my husband and I went to this place to celebrate a friend's birthday. The place is a mix of Latin music where waiters with make-up of Mexican skulls and dancers dressed in horror characters, including a dwarf dressed as Hulk, however, with ghostly expression, they perform on the floor and on tables, in addition to tequila shots. We were searched in person, right at the entrance, the reservation did not meet what was proposed regarding the number of consumers. A table reservation had been made, which they (inexplicably) limit to four places, although the number of accommodations is higher.The place was still empty and we were allocated elsewhere and, while we waited for the tables and chairs to be set up, we were rudely approached by the attendant who asked if there was permission for my husband, who was already consuming, to wait seated on the edge of one of the many empty seats of the tidy box, read a set of red upholstery, with cubic arrangement, for consummation of R $ 600.00. Without understanding the impolite treatment, we sat down at the table and waited for 'congratulations', when the dancers started their presentation, when one of the young people (aged 23) with a black elf mask passed out and for our amazement, it was not possible to see a doctor who was there, or anyone else, as security guards prevented him, including taking him to the back of the house.Minutes passed, the boy remained unconscious, and it was necessary to activate the SAMU, where another constraint was created by the local security guards, transferring the boy into the administration, a place out of sight of those present.From then on, we started to be watched by security guards as if something could worsen what was already a pity.At the time, we ended the bad experience, we saw the wrong treatment for naive consumers who believed that Mexican colors and designs represented a moment of joy, however, the concern that remains is not only in dealing not only with customers, repeated in other evaluations, but also due to the neglect of its employees.This is not the place that I look for or recommend to appreciate the rare hours of rest.\n",
      "Mediterranean dish was great, prawn entree Recife great, garcon Josué excellent, dessert 10!\n",
      "Although they have good sushi, on Tuesdays, the service becomes precarious with people fighting over waiters. It would be better for them to reassess and no longer offer the service.\n",
      "For those who like a homemade food and are not demanding with a luxurious atmosphere, the Ponto Certo restaurant is sure to satisfy your need!\n",
      "Nice atmosphere, very good buffet, good variety of meats. Against: just because there is no kids space.\n",
      "Right away it was the hamburger shop where the service was faster (no queues and the snack was ready fast). I ordered the one of the week (Australian bread, bacon and cheddar). Juicy, good cheddar (just like Mc Donald's, crispy bacon). The house sauce was beaten in the middle of this combination. The only thing that could improve in the meat is the flavor issue: a punch was missing. Very soft bread, it held the fat of the meat without going limp. Onion rings sequinhas, it's worth it. The potato is very common, nothing much. Refill refill. They have a seasoned salt on the tables which is very good. Mix in the mayonnaise and it is very good to accompany the fries and onion rings. Joined my list, in the top 3.\n",
      "I was in Vitoria on business and despite not having any reference I decided to visit Oriundi. It is a typical Italian canteen, the service was super friendly, the chef was available in the lounge to greet customers and my pasta was a show. It was super worth knowing, if I return to ES I will definitely return to taste the other dishes.\n",
      "Wonderful snacks, better than traditional fast foods, better service too. If it wasn't far from where I live I would always go, but I will be back for sure.\n",
      "We were with friends. We all love it. The service is excellent. Fair price. Super nice atmosphere. And the main thing: the food is magnificent. Let's go back! Congratulations.\n",
      "Have lunch facing the sea, not with the breeze on your face. The food is well served, the dishes are for two people and the yummy was great. The ladies who attend were a love\n",
      "Excellent service, easy access, very pleasant atmosphere and delicious food (starter, main course and dessert)!\n",
      "Empada is not good for the advertising they do, it is small and not tasty! I would never return !!!\n",
      "Small, waiting in the sun, and very poor food. I asked for eggs benny, with no flavor, bacon in cubes instead of strips, and the sauce, which came very little, was anything but Dutch. Watery fruit juice and the straw they offer is made of bamboo, very unhygienic. Bad fries, bbk sauce worse. Amateur food and service. I do not recommend.\n",
      "Extremely careful with customers. Fuindireto on the yellow hake roasted over the coals. For me it was something from outside this planet. I didn't even care about the famous sun meat. There is the beautiful option for appreciation. Fair price for the dishes. For drinks, not so much.\n",
      "Best pizza to eat standing up with a little guarana or the indefectible cashew juice. Only muzzarella and you can order a neat double!\n",
      "I've been to São Luís / MA 3 times and I always have to have lunch at Cabana do Sol. The food is delicious, but the quantity is exorbitant, I ordered half a dish and it was enough to have lunch with my husband, my daughter and me, and we were fine satisfied.Another delight of this restaurant are the pastries with pepper jelly that they serve as a starter, they are magnificent.\n",
      "Pleasant, family atmosphere, good service.Very varied menu, from the trivial to the typical of the region and fair and affordable value.\n",

      "Excellent place for those who like to have a very varied menu, from Tuesday and Friday so that has a barbecue is sensational ...\n",
      "Delicious, abundant, inexpensive food with good service. My only caveat is the waiting time. depending on the time there is a huge queue, but the facilities are clean and very well decorated. great service.\n",
      "We went to this place because of one of the waiters, who approached people on the street to talk about the restaurant. I don't know his name, but he was an extremely nice man. We decided to get in to know. The service was good, we ate portions, which were not very large, but very tasty, and affordable. Very varied menu, very cold beer, and all this with a beautiful view of Ponta Negra beach. Weak point was due to the ice cream we ordered for dessert and the restaurant did not have it.\n",
      "Excellent service, exquisite and tasty dishes! Local, international cuisine, in short, there are dishes for all tastes, I chose filet mignon and it was wonderful! Dish worthy of a photo! Unmissable!\n",
      "Nice place. Cold beer, despite little variety. PIzza grande serves 3 adults well. I really enjoyed the carne de sol pizza (exotic flavor for those coming from the southeast) and Vignoli.I highly recommend it to anyone, like me, who likes thin crust, which by the way was quite crunchy.Different way of serving - eat with your hand using plastic gloves.Polite waiter and very good service. Fairly priced for the pizza and ambience.\n",
      "Great for going with friends to eat Japanese food. It also offers dishes that are not oriental cuisine. I recommend...\n",

      "we went to have our aracaju farewell, choose, the restaurant by Trip, and it was disappointing, the atmosphere and beautiful, we already knew it would be an expensive restaurant, but being expensive would not be the main issue, what we most expected was that they were good surprising, striking, and everything was the other way around. The service and cold, the positioning of the matre and the waiters and as if they were superior to the customers, a certain arrogance in explaining the dishes, as if we had the guests doing us a favor by being there, we ordered a plate of sea bass file in the sauce shrimp sauce, it was a disappointment, the shrimp sauce tastes like industrialized tomato sauce, not to mention that in the shrimp sauce comes 2 prawns, the other dish was file with wine sauce and funghi with baked potatoes, the file was good but the sauce was another disappointment, it had 1 funghi, the baked potato is not even mentioned and a baked potato with parmesan sprinkled and put in the oven. I certainly don't recommend this restaurant.\n"

The waiters are attentive and the dishes are brought directly by the kitchen staff, which I thought was fantastic. Would definitely return!\n",
      "A good bakery that serves the region very well. Simple, but with varieties of products in the bakery and also with basic goods that we sometimes need in the kitchen.\n",
      "Love the ravine by the environment, having lunch under trees is spectacular. The food is delicious, especially the fried polenta ... Adoroooo! The pork loin with cheese is one of my favorite dishes.\n",
      "Very nice place, with delicious and varied skewers, even bogogi (sweet and sour meat), sweet skewers and the famous creamy cassava. Cold beer in the late afternoon, very close to Aclimação Park. Great request.\n",
      "A stripped-down environment, the house offers a buffet with trivial Brazilian cuisine. On Saturdays, lunch is more neat, with feijoada, varied dishes and homemade desserts arranged at a buffet.\n",
      "A good option on the island of milk, varied menu, with several options, self service that caters to the most varied tastes ...\n",
      "The restaurant environment, at the Hotel Paulista Wall Street, is very comfortable and elegant, and the service is attentive and courteous; however, the food is poor. There is a great range of salads, but the hot dishes are common, little varied and dissonant with the sophistication of the place: polenta, noodles in sugo sauce, grilled fish, breaded chicken and creamed spinach were the most appetizing options. For the price (R $ 41.90), it should offer more.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant, delicious food, well served dishes, very pleasant atmosphere, efficient service. Worth it.\n",
      "Top restaurant .. with a beautiful, spacious and pleasant atmosphere. The restaurant has a different façade and its interior has a sophisticated decoration, including an air-conditioned wine cellar and a playroom for children. The service is grade 10.The shrimp dishes serve 2 people peacefully and cost in the range of R $ 115. We savor the shrimp the parmigiana, which was exceptional and very well prepared. I recommend!!\n",
      "I really loved the place, especially the juices that are delicious and also the vitamins worth visiting the place\n",
      "A great place to go at the end of the day for a snack or dinner with friends, from sandwich to meat dishes, several delicious options. And for dessert I recommend ordering the brownie, deli, deli!\n",
      "Where the famous shrimp bubble gum is served, especially for those who like cheese. Very pleasant and sophisticated environment.\n",
      "Small atmosphere, a little rustic, beautiful view of the theater, very good cuisine, not so attractive prices, but worth the visit.\n",
      "When my sister took me there, my god I almost died eating, both the pizzas and the pasta are wonderful, the salad is not far behind, whenever I go to Porto Alegre, they ask me where we are going to have dinner, and guess what the answer is ??????? Ninth Ludovico ....\n",
      "Minas Gerais food, as it should be, a small place, with many tables, always full, and serving in two ways: ala carte and buffet by kilo (but with little variety of food). Poor table service.Time-consuming to access and to help yourself.\n",
      "Gaucha reception, ribs on the spit and ember right at the entrance, SP is diverse, the Gauchos feel at home and those from other states as if they were at home, due to the treatment given.\n",

      "Very good restaurant! Several options for all tastes, many options of salads and meats.Their service system is different, it is not self-service. You must choose your options of salad and side dishes, meat and dessert if desired. I suggest knowing the system beforehand and choosing your dish before taking the queue.\n",
      "So far the best food in Fortaleza. Try the royal shrimp, mmmm .... a delight! Band of singer André Lua very cool! All within the environment of the Cultural Center Dragão do Mar.\n",
      "We taste a very tasty pizza, prepared with good quality ingredients. Very kind and careful service.\n",
      "Bar do Espartano is on the edge of the Gasometer overlooking Lake Guaíba. It has outdoor tables. Place your order at the checkout, take it out in the kitchen and take it to your table. Drinks for R $ 30.00. Saturday night had live music\n",
      "The service is great and the place is nice. But for the price it was not worth it, I have already eaten in much better restaurants.It is necessary to order a whole portion for two people and neither was very hungry or rotating. The taste of the food is more or less and does not have much variety.\n",
      "The title already says. Better than the other restaurant of the same kind here in the city. I love Italian food and have had the opportunity to eat at other Italian restaurants outside Porto Velho, so I guarantee you have nothing to complain about. The food is excellent. Order the Gnocchi four cheeses. Very good. The architecture is also to be congratulated. Very well designed in every detail. A real Italian home. Nice lighting. Different environments. And the wine cellar looks like it was actually dug in the dirt. For those who like a chat on the sidewalk also has this option. All rooms are at the height of a first class restaurant.\n",
      "This restaurant follows the standard of Good and Cheap. Delicious food, I didn't even have to look for a place outside the event that was at the Convention Center, throughout the event we ate at it. You can rest assured that the food is good.\n",

      "For those who like a real snack, this is the ideal, perfect, I always miss you, you'll love it!\n",
      "I speak of Poor Juan of Shopping Cidade Jardim. It has a very good location, the atmosphere is very pleasant, good food, good wines and beautiful people. In fact a very good place to take your girlfriend or boyfriend. On the other hand, it is also a very familiar environment.While you wait for a table, at the restaurant bar you can have a Martini.For dinner I suggest ancho steak (wonderful) and good wine.I hope you can take advantage of the tip.\n",
      "Best regional restaurant in Manaus, good prices, good location, good service, Wi-Fi and parking.\n",
      "I went for the first time two years ago, when I was in Natal. Returning now, we returned and, once again, we found it delicious. The place is super nice. Small, but elegant and cozy. It has great service and great food! A must-have smoked duck carpaccio with apricot puree !! My dish, duck magret flambéed with cointreau and shitake rice, was exceptional. Great dessert too, crepe with cointreau sauce and tapioca ice cream. Too bad it takes me a long time to come to Natal. Prices are compatible with the restaurant level.\n",
      "Wonderful açai cups and the best, with qtas toppings to enter the cup.Good serviceIt's only bad to find a place on the street, a busy place.It has from 200ml to 750ml.It also has cupuaçu and pitaya.\n",
      "The fame of the place is not justified. It is really a small door, located in a narrow street, with a few chairs without a table on the sidewalk, making people eat literally on the street, with plates and plastic cutlery. I do not argue that the things that are served have any quality. But it is nothing extraordinary. Small dishes and snacks are served without any comfort and without any special flavor. Not worth it. Forget it because it is a place to have a meal. It is a small street cafeteria. Literally a small door.\n"

      "I loved everything! The restaurant is super beautiful and well decorated, with that cozy atmosphere and piped music. The service is fast and efficient, and my orders arrived in good time. We ordered funghi risotto with bacon and another sausage with taioba, both with great rice and seasoning in the right measure. The starter, sausage with red wine and parmesan sauce, was delicious, very tasty sauce. Prices are fair, and cheaper than most similar restaurants in the region. It gets really crowded after 8pm, so schedule it. Super nominate and I'll be back for sure!\n",
      "Excellent environment especially for those who like to enjoy a very northeastern music, with a lining of the foot. All the waiters wear typical clothes with leather hats that they can borrow so we can take some pictures. The food is also very regional, but there is a food with the name of hidden meat that you must try. the place is very well decorated. The owner is very well known is the famous sandro Beckmam ceiling tile.\n",
      "We arrived to test the recommendation made by my brother-in-law Rogerio Carvalho about the octopus roasted in the special oven of the house, almost at the end of the lunch hour. We received a special service from Vinicius and DAlley with fantastic suggestions and really exceptional. Wonderful afternoon in every way.

      "*** Make reservations well in advance ***We went to dinner at Nina, they only accept reservations between 7pm and 7:30 pm, there is no point in going there without making reservations, they usually open with 100% capacity / reservations inside the restaurant. If you are very lucky you will find a table outside, otherwise you will have to wait for a table to vacate.We were well attended by Roman and Felipe also stopped by the table a few times to offer help.The menu has good options for starters and good and affordable pasta. my lasagna cost R $ 48, and it was delicious. CAUTION, the water despite being served in small pots and thinking it is complimentary, they charge, even if little.The amount of food is ok and worth the request.The wine menu is very varied, many options absurdly expensive, but if you look for it, there are also great affordable options.So, for all tastes and recommend.Romantic place, good for meetings and or family.Cost + _ 160 per person.\n",

      "Good atmosphere, the beach in front is not the best because the sea is very rough.The service is good but the prices are very expensive even for a different beach environment.Worth knowing!Weekday is empty so for those who want to escape the hustle and bustle it is a good thing\n",

      "We chose Mitsuba for special situations. Good atmosphere but its strong point is the cuisine. We always asked for a standard combo, but I strongly suggest asking for the boss's special combo. God!! Delicious. Beautiful cuts with fresh pieces and a drool flavor. You will not regret.\n",
      "American standard restaurant. The service of both the Patio and BH Shopping units leaves much to be desired ... delay in service, they often forget the order ...I ordered white wine about 2 times and, in addition to a few options, I did not like the wine, one came to the table spoiled (I believe it does not have much choice). Meats are tasty\n",
      "My sister's birthday celebration, a great place to gather friends! everything was very good\n",
      "I asked for delivery on a Saturday, and the estimated delivery time was fulfilled precisely, although it took a little time. Very kind and cordial service, and they give a free gift to each order. I recommend the pepperoni bread, very tasty.\n",

      "Very average breakfast, unfortunately I did not book including breakfast so I had to pay the part, expensive breakfast for few options and the food was very average. The rooms are new and have tiled floors (good for those who are allergic to carpeting) and this is a super positive point, but I don't know if I would be staying again.\n",
      "I didn't like it, the terrible lamb, dry shrimp, heart of artichokes my God ... despite the diversity of the buffet it didn't have much flavor .. I was in better.\n",
      "Sensational pizza, thin crust in the wood oven and with options ranging from classic to contemporary. For those who like it, the pizza with garlic is a pleasant surprise.

      "The sandwiches are good, the atmosphere is simple, the service could be a little better. But it is the typical snack bar that has become a tradition in the city and will not change. The house filet sandwich costs R $ 19.90, Cheese Filet for 13.50. There are combos for R $ 19.90 that includes potatoes and soda. But if it doesn't please, McDonald's is right next door.\n",

      "I have been to this restaurant a few times at different times. Currently, I think it is declining a little, but it still offers a good level of satisfaction and price. The carvery is reasonable, with some good options, like shimeji on the plate, very tasty. Well-cut sashimis.One night I opted for a ceviche and I also liked it a lot. It is worth a visit.\n",

Very Good !! (ps: it is worth trying the lemonade).\n",
      "The disappointment started on arrival, the service was slow and time consuming, the girl who should take the order to get ahead was in the biggest chat with colleagues at the end of the line with the clipboard in hand, and the GIANT line. The cashier who was attending my line was threatening to abandon the service with the manager, who came with a giant bag of coins and was counting in a corner near where the potatoes and not even there for the people who were attending. After more than 20 minutes I went to withdraw my order, my son's chocolate milkshake was simply bitter, and the smell of rotten, when requesting the exchange, was still of little concern to me. Well, I went on the Tuesday of Carnival around 7 pm, for those who want to research who were the employees who were working in the period. The cashier who answered me was the one on the right on the wall with the Arab restaurant. I do not recommend this unit. I am much more BK.\n",

      "We don't even have to talk about the food, the Outback is great in all the units I have been to.I highly recommend the Tasmanian lamb and rice, as well as the wonderful chocolate thunder.The only problem with this Paulista unit is the service that is a little lost, when my boyfriend asked for fanta, they sent coca cola, orders took a long time to arrive but nothing that would spoil the experience.It really is a very nice place and the view of Av. Paulista is beautiful, it is worth waiting and asking for a table by the window.\n"

The Chief of the House, Geraldinho, has an elephant memory: even after months without seeing me, he calls me by name; the partner and wife play with the children with sympathy.

In general, the food is very weak and the service is terrible - the attendants are far from where the customers sit, especially during off-peak hours. Expensive, without imagination or creativity. Only go even if nothing is open. And look over there.\n",

      "The place is pleasant and worth at least 1 visit. If you want to go back, that's another thing.Strengths:- very polite employees;- some dishes are well done and delicious; others, not so much;Negative points:- wine list with ABSURD prices !!! For those who like to drink wine, this place is impossible. Now, if you have a lot of money, then you will have no problems;- then you think, ok, I'm going to have a beer! Beer costs R $ 28!

      "in addition to serving a free buffet and a kilo, the Jefe Grill serves great ready-made dishes, with emphasis on their A la minute, which is a great cost benefit.The service is generally very fast and efficient. For a meal, it is one of the best in the total mall.\n",

      "Very good Temakis with below average prices in Recife.Works with clone scheme for most temakis (which makes it cheap). The temaki costs between R $ 15 and R $ 20, with the right to another clone.There is also sushi in the weight (in addition to the options to display, there is the possibility to order others, which are made on the spot).The ambience is spacious and simple, but it makes up for the taste and the price.Offers regional food by weight\n",

      "Saturday lunch, skip the line, very nice and cute atmosphere, great service. We ordered a prawn lasagna with brie cheese for 2, which was great, and a cod lasagna, which was also delicious but had some pimples that bothered us. For dessert the bottino pavé is from the gods!\n",
      "Restaurant with varied dishes, good salads, pleasant atmosphere. Fair prices and attentive waiters.\n",

      "Very nice tent, with typical food and cozy atmosphere ...Good music all day !!!Only the part of the beach that is in front of the tent is not very good\n",
      "I always start my evaluations talking about expectations.I received excellent feedbacks about the restaurant before the visit, although many reviews here say the opposite - and we were confident.Our visit took place on a Saturday night. We were in a large group, but the staff arrived at 7 pm to get a table - gold tip. That's because it fills up a lot - around 8 pm there were no tables available.Setting: large and unique lounge, comfortable tables and chairs, air conditioning at the ideal temperature. We were close to the exit and I didn't smell it, but I could see that there was a little smoke next to the kitchen, which should be quite annoying!Service: excellent from start to finish. All the attendants were kind and quick. Some orders took a while to arrive, but the house was full and the delay was not long, so ok.Food: nice variety of items in the carvery, flexibility in ordering temakis (I am terrified of restaurants that limit half a dozen flavors, or do not accept small changes - which I eventually order, as I prefer diced salmon instead of beaten, and without rice). Hot and cold dishes were very tasty, with large portions and free repetitions (no drama or rolling, you know?).Drinks: We drink beer, soda and tonic water. All orders came accordingly.Cost x benefit: it is a great restaurant to go to lunch or dinner, considering the carvery on weekends at R $ 70. In this sense, the cost-benefit ratio is very good. As we went with a group and consumed alcoholic drinks, I thought it was average, since this type of establishment has drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) with high value.Final considerations: we were with two birthdays, and both won a delicious dessert (and great, wow !! lol).Worth the visit!\n",
      "Typical restaurant, with food from Goiás and Minas Gerais. For visitors, a place where they will certainly know what is eaten in this state. for residents, a great leisure option.\n",
      "Very good restaurant and it was the best baião de dois I have ever tasted.The dishes are huge and very well served, so I suggest a plate for three people. Quiet and family atmosphere. Special place for children.\n",
      "I went in December, I found the service deficient. The flavors of the pizzas were repeated successively and many flavors did not pass. Sweet pizzas, which were the best in the house, fell short of other times.\n",
      "pizza with thin crust very well made, with a nice atmosphere and well frequented a place for families and friends with good wines and a cold beer\n",
      "It's been a wonderful night. Incredible food. Excellent service by the waiter Leo. I will always come back.\n",
      "We went to the Emperor on the beach, and the atmosphere is very good, the service also, although the girl who attended us curled up a bit with the wine opener, but nothing much, she was super friendly. We tried the smaller shrimp gum as a starter, because we thought it would be nauseating, but as a small portion I thought it was very good, we ordered a Shrimp Pajuçara that was divine, and the quantity is very good. It was great, and when I return to Maceió I will definitely book a night there.\n",
      "I went by indication.Tasty meat.Cold beer.Very good service!Wonderful dessert!Worth knowing!Refrigerated environment.Below the restaurant, a warehouse with all the meat on the menu and much more!\n",

      "At random, I ended up stopping at Tototó on a holiday. Simple restaurant located in a building that is also a cultural space. Discreet place, with a view of the Sergipe river. The environment has a very cozy balcony. We were well received and attended to by friendly waitresses. Right away we received the courtesy of a bean soup. At the beginning we ordered a cassava disk with cheese and dried meat - tasty - but we were not informed that it was an individual portion. As a main course I ordered a shrimp stew with plantains - although it seems small, it served two people well. For dessert, a very common chocolate pudding. I call attention to the location of difficult parking.\n",
      "This restaurant is very good. On the night that I went, the service was not the best, the waiters were a bit distraught. The Chef was at the table, which I found very interesting. Delicious cuisine. It is worth it for a romantic dinner.\n",
      "I loved this restaurant. With the menu totally focused on Paraense cuisine (which is wonderful), they have absurdly great prices! - considering being located in an upscale neighborhood where prices are usually higher. Very pleasant atmosphere, great service. Try the dish called Vataçoba, this mixture is sensational.\n",
      "Couvert R $ 22 / person - very worth it, a delicious roll, butter seasoned with herbs, olive oil and a cheese with tomato jam.Main dishes - I ordered the carbonara ravioli with lemon sauce, very good, well served, very unusual flavor. My boyfriend ordered the gnocchi with prawns, very different, extremely delicious sauce and perfect prawns, but if you're really hungry, it might be a little.Dessert - chocolate soufflé with ice cream - worth all the calories\n"

It is worth mentioning the environments of very good taste. But the highlight is the quality of care, meticulous and attentive. I don't consider it a cheap place, but the bill is fair for what the establishment offers.\n",
      "Homemade food, well prepared. Reasonable variety at an average price. The meat is heavy apart and the desserts are the same. Convenient parking is moderately close as it is impossible to park on the street. The agreement exists from R $ 20.00 (minimum consumption)\n",

      "Those who look outside may not give anything for the place. The region is also not one of the most pleasant in the city.But just give Galeto 183 a chance to get to know one of the best meats in Rio de Janeiro.The place is always crowded, there are few waiters, the service is confusing, the house is noisy, on summer days the heat is almost unbearable, and even with all that, it is still worth it.The highlights of the house, in addition to the traditional Angu do Gomes (original recipe!)

      "The restaurant is fantastic and in great demand, we had to book a week in advance. The menu is incredible, with a wide choice of starters, main courses and desserts, with a fair price and delicious.There are some negative points that can be better, a sommelier is lacking to guide customers; wines with abusive values; the waiters are attentive, but we had the impression that they were in a hurry to clear the table soon, insisting on ordering all the time; around 9:30 pm, the sound volume increased, making it impossible to have a pleasant dialogue, and making the atmosphere look like a ballad and not a restaurant.\n",

      "We went on 03/11/17, I asked my fiancee for a shrimp stew, it wasn't bad, but for the price it should be much better and less tasteless, weiss beer was served in a regular beer glass, for this beer it is necessary a bigger glass where all the beer can fit, how can a restaurant of this size pay attention to something like that? I was still curious to know the dish with sun meat, but I think it is better to give up and not come back to pay dearly for something without seasoning, I believe that in a northern house such dish will be much more tasty.\n",

It has a beautiful view of the river and despite not having air conditioning the constant breeze leaves the atmosphere pleasant.\n"

We had a wine, whose menu is very salty, and dinner came out for no less than 300.00! And parking, which belongs to the bistro itself, is charged separately !!

      "I tried the most popular dishes in the house. Chicken with brown sauce (sauce prepared with a little chicken blood) and with okra. The value of 58 reais, the whole chicken, with the option of half the chicken in the brown sauce, half with okra. Drinks, reasonable prices for natural juices, beers and wines. Regarding the environment, very simple accommodation and I was well attended. There is also a leisure space for children. I didn't see any monitors. It will also be worth it, for those who like the history of Brazil, as there are several photos, reports and reports referring to JK.\n",
      "I went with my girlfriend to the Village Mail unit on 06/23.I ordered a seafood paella waiting for a dish with the standard quality of the house. The dish was made with parboiled rice instead of arboreal rice, in addition to having a small amount of seafood.I pondered with the waiter and he said that the house does not make the dish with arboreal rice due to the increased cost. I consulted the average price of the item's kilo and it is around 12 reais / kilo.It was really a frustrating experience and one that I think I won't recommend to my social cycle.\n",
      "Cozy atmosphere with wonderful food, delicious pasta and an extensive wine list. I have been several times and I really like the food.\n",
      "The house offers great fish options. The cod stands out, obviously. Do not fear, any option will be very well done and served. The house looks like a bar, but the food is exceptional.\n",
      "The restaurant is the chain's standard. The dishes were loud and well done. The service was kind and efficient. I was surprised by the speed with which the food arrived, an important issue for those who have little time to eat.\n",
      "It's not fast food. It's real Arab food! Forget that dry and tasteless sfiha that is out there. It has texture, it has flavor. Dry curd, tabbouleh and hummus also very tasty.\n",
      "For those who remember the Donut's franchise, here is a place that has reasonable products and some variations of fillings, such as the happy and tasty banana and cinnamon option. The strawberry jam I didn't find so tasty, because it was not filled with a 'lady jam', but just a gelatin flavored with artificial strawberry.If you lack the courage ($) to invest in a large donut or if there is doubt between flavors, opt for mini-donuts. Tiny to eat with a mouthful, but a good one for those who want to try various flavors and then decide to take a normal size one.\n",
      "I was surprised by a wonderful dinner at Le Jazz.Super friendly service from the employee Marcio.Despite the full restaurant, as it is a busy date, the service was very good.The dishes arrived hot and without delay.I will definitely be back at a later opportunity ..\n",
      "I was surprised by what was presented to me. Rodizio hearty, well executed, at a very attractive price. Return without a doubt.\n",
      "It is one of the most frequent restaurants in town. The food is of excellent quality. Worth the visit.\n",
      "Very tasty sandwich, excellent quality ingredients, delicious bread. The combination of ingredients is perfect. Best sandwich I have ever eaten.\n",
      "Everyone recommended the Camarões restaurant, I went and what I liked the most in this restaurant was the dessert, soft cocada with tapioca ice cream, just wonderful.\n",
      "Very good food and even better service !!! The Grouper barbecue and the Grouper Bait are incredible !!! The tidy tb is very good !!! Service note 10 !!!\n",
      "I went to this restaurant three times during my stay in Maceió. The first time was at the beachfront unit, more sophisticated, with dishes identical to the other, but more expensive. The food was not the best, but it was reasonably good. I ordered a cod and my husband, prawns with potatoes au gratin. Our second experience was at the unit on the beach promenade. Out of curiosity, we ordered a mini Shrimp Gum. Honestly, I was amazed that this was the flagship of the restaurant. Even though it is a small portion, my husband, my daughter and I cannot eat everything. Extremely strong and greasy! The last time, to close with a flourish, we went to dinner in this unit of the boardwalk. I ordered a spaghetti with fillet in a sugo sauce, unmatchable ... raw pasta and the tomato sauce looked like lemon, it was so acidic! My husband's dish, ditto! Raw rice, raw vegetables and lots of fat. The fish, although tasty, was very small.\n",
      "Good restaurant, good service, weak menu and average food. So don't create expectations.Good location, close to the General Osório subway and plenty of public transport. Simple and cozy atmosphere.\n",
      "Today the 16th I decided to have a lighter dinner with my wife, since at lunch we ate a lot of shrimp with cassava and potato tape.So we found this restaurant on the same trip and went to meet him in person. It was a very pleasant night, the place was cozy, the live music was of quality and in volume that we could talk quietly, the service was exceptional.We ate a pizza of the size GG - 8 large slices with a very light and delicious thin crust.For those in Ponta Negra it is a nice place to go.\n",
      "Amazing experience! Wonderful tasting menu and fresh and fun presentation! Worth all the success!Felipe-carioca was super friendly and efficient\n",
      "La Tambouille is one of the most traditional restaurants in São Paulo, and certainly one of the best! The atmosphere is great, sophisticated without being snobbish and the food is one of the best I've ever tasted in the whole world! Excellent wine list completes the items needed to make this one of the top restaurants in Sao Paulo.\n",
      "Wonderful!!!! Very good service, cold beer !!!! There is also a fried fish that comes with side dishes, perfect !!!!\n",
      "Beautiful and well decorated environment, with internal and external spaces with a beautiful garden. Food and service very good. Great option for a romantic dinner.\n",
      "It has a whole stuffed fish that is wonderful !!!!and the snacks are also delicious, it’s very worth going.\n",
      "Great service from the waiter Silvio. Delicious food and a super cozy place. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "We watched the Flemish game with tranquility despite the rain. Cold beer and delicious snacks! Owner of the sick flamenco bar.\n",
      "Best cocktail bar in sp. All drinks of high quality and extremely well balanced. They also serve good food and adequate to the proposal of the Bar.\n",
      "Restaurant with excellent seafood and a huge variety on the menu. There are pizzas and crepes that are also delicious and the caipirosca is top.\n",
      "Excellent reataurante, uncomfortable chairs, simple food but very good, no parking,\n",
      "Great place to spend an afternoon, have a drink, and have a nice lunch. The decor is fabulous and Enda food is really great. Damian Montecer with his fantastic experience take Tereze all his way of knowing very special cuisine in the world.\n"

      "We love the famous shrimp gum, a restaurant next to the Mercure Pajuçara, there is also a branch on the beach in a kind of air-conditioned and very beautiful kiosk. Excellent service. The restaurant also has a transfer service.\n",
      "Restaurant with a beautiful view and pleasant and sophisticated atmosphere. The service is not good, but when we are talking about an expensive restaurant, it could be better. The food is good, but I didn't find anything exceptional. Like a fish in the cashew crust, which was cooked to perfection, however I thought the dish lacked more flavor. On the other hand, the accompaniment of conventional rice with wild rice was divine. In short, it is a good restaurant but for what it charges I expected a lot more. It is worth the visit for the environment and the view or to take some special guest, but I suggest not going with so much expectation in the dishes so as not to be disappointed.\n",
      "The Gero de Ipanema, besides being a classic, also has an executive menu during lunch on weekdays.For R $ 98.00, the customer is entitled to starter, main course and dessert!It's not cheap, but it's worth it !!!The quality of the dishes and the atmosphere are wonderful !!!\n",
      "We went on a Monday, July 22nd. We ordered 3 dishes, a bamboo coconut tilapia and two white fish à belle muniere.We waited more than 1 hour for the dishes, they came clearly cold, ironed and tasted like old.The only thing that was really worth it was the breaded shrimp that we ordered for starter.In short: Bad choice, we expected something much more elaborate and tasty. I recommend Bar do Victor restaurant for those who want to eat fish in Curitiba.\n",
      "Great seasoning. It lives up to Bahia's fame. It is worth seeing what this restaurant has. it's very clean. The price is well taken into account.\n",
      "What appears to be a Japanese restaurant, turns out to be diverse by looking closely at the menu. My experience was great: differentiated service, pleasant decor, agility to serve the dish and the taste, incredible! I ate a pumpkin risotto with dried meat, accompanied by fried plantains and crispy kale. Um ... I'm already mouth watering!\n",
      "For those who want a snack, a tapioca, a coffee, the place has a very tasteful decoration and very tasty food. It's very pleasant.\n",
      "I have known Sapore for about 6 years and after the renovation the environment became even more beautiful. Pleasant environment.\n",
      "fast service, clean and pleasant place, but the food leaves a little to be desired by the taste. the accompaniment of seafood dishes leaves much to be desired.\n",
      "We went for a snack at DRI, at Shopping da Gávea. We were two people. We ordered a homemade sausage sandwich and a gaufre. At first, I didn't believe that the gaufre would be as good as the Belgians. But for me, it was a pleasant surprise: it was great, light, very well done, in the same consistency as the Belgians and other countries. What I didn't like so much was the whipped cream. It was sickening, very sweet.The sandwich was also very good. Very friendly place, good service, great for a post-cinema visit.\n",
      "The food is excellent and the mariachis are great fun. If you want a spot for a quiet dinner, this is not the place - but that is not a criticism. The proposal is a lively night, with music, good food and tequila. We celebrate a birthday with a fun tequila ritual. I recommend!\n",
      "I went to lunch to try a dish from a festival. I liked the decor, light and nice, the service (waitresses a little lost, but polite and fun). Nice, tasty dish, nothing extraordinary. It was worth knowing, and I recommend it for a good risotto.\n",
      "Super attentive attendants, dedicated to providing a great service. Air-conditioned and super pleasant environment, worth checking out.\n",
      "Restaurant with a pleasant and tasteful look, few tables, friendly service and always very good. The simple dishes (no difference with those presented in the coastal dalmo) and there was confusion regarding the orders.\n",
      "Make no mistake: if you want quality Japanese food, it's at Udon! Very varied menu and very tasty dishes. Not to mention the excellent service. We were attended by Warley and he was very polite, attentive and always ready to help us with our menu questions. We will be back and recommend it!\n",
      "We went in a group of coworkers. The restaurant's specialty is carvery, mainly regional. For those who eat a lot it is a good tip, but it is not the place for you to taste a specific dish (if you choose the carvery, you may even have this option). If you know how to select from the many options offered, you will be satisfied.\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, excellent dishes both in taste and presentation. Very good service. Affordable value too. Congratulations to the team!\n",
      "Excellent pizza, in a super nice and comfortable place and the best: kids space with monitors !!!!Not to mention the service, super polite and friendly staff, from the door security, which made all the difference in our choice for the restaurant.\n",
      "Asian international cuisine, very well prepared dishes and with great quality, I recommend it to everyone who likes Japanese food\n",
      "It has a variety of different drinks, with regional characteristics. However, they are not very cold and quickly heat up in the disposable cup in which they are served.\n",
      "Pleasant, romantic atmosphere ideal for special occasions! Charming decor, excellent service and unforgettable food. Valet service and specialized wine cellar complement the service. I hope to be back soon.\n",
      "I love Arab food, but being vegetarian and lactose intolerant I stopped at falafel and pastries outside the house. So, I was pleasantly surprised by Rachid's. There are about 4 vegetarian kebab options, which can be adapted for vegans. I noticed a vegetarian combo on the menu and I believe I had a vegetarian kibbeh option as well. I tried the kebabs: original falafel, falafel with tabbouleh and cauliflower. I loved everyone, but I vote for the original falafel for a first test! I am a bit of an oyster in eating (hihi), but size has killed my hunger. There are some pastries that are very small and these I do not recommend, only if it is an entry for something else. Prices ranged between R $ 25 and 28 for kebabs. Makes delivery and does not work on Mondays.\n",
      "Pizzas, taste and beers excellent !! Very good atmosphere and service !! Super recommend, for group of friends, couples and family !!\n",
      "The restaurant's atmosphere is very old, it deserves urgent renovation. The value of the dish does not live up to what is served, nor the environment. It is impressive that it is a gallery, but if you want to eat chicken you have to ask, because the dish is not available at the buffet.\n",
      "DisappointingThe delay of more than 1 hour for a basic Portuguese pizza / 4 cheeses made us sure that the waitress had forgotten to place the orderHorrible presentation, average taste nothing interestingP.S - the shapes that come with the pizza are just horrible, very old, we observed that in all the tables that ordered pizzaWe will not indicate well we intend to return at this location\n",
      "I took my husband on his birthday night.He as a connoisseur and passionate about beer loved it.Thousands of options. There are other drinks like drinks and caipirinhas on the menu.We stayed in the portions that were delicious.We set all consumption on my husband's command. Mine did not come out of the bag, when paying I had 2 beers launched. They took it off without a problem, but if I hadn't been aware it would have passed.This has already happened to a couple of friends of ours, but they didn't realize it at the time.\n",
      "As they said, Lots of lobster!. Excellent restaurant! First rate service! Buffet´s super complete of: Salads, Japanese Food and Seafood !!! It also has a carvery. Great place for dinner! It pays off!\n",
      "nice restaurant, very good service, great food at a fair price, excellent location. I'll be back more often ...\n",
      "I always went there, but I had never stopped, one day a friend asked me to go to lunch there. I was very grateful for the invitation because I was very satisfied with what I found: organization, cleanliness, good service and delicious food.The only thing I didn't like about the presentation of the dishes, is either individual or for 4 people. Since the individual is a lot for one person and little for two, and for 4 I found it expensive and the amount insufficient.I came back again and the amount had increased ... I will always come back !!!!\n"

It took the table and the pizza arrived a little cold, which compromised the flavor a little.Despite this, I will be back again.

On top is the restaurant with delicious dishes (highlight the grilled sea bass with cream) The atmosphere is cozy and fun and the service is great.

      "Restaurant well located with parking nearby, super nice atmosphere.The dishes vary from 25 to 40 reais, which makes the restaurant very attractive for those looking for Italian food. We ordered the fetuccini with filet and it was very tasty. The only thing is that the dough was too broken to roll, but nothing that would get in the way too much.Wines from 40 reais. A real find in BH. I want to go back!\n",
      "In the old days, but in the old days it was reasonable! I was with an Italian supplier and I really hated it, I managed to leave hungry! In these types of restaurants I always ask for lamb ....... after I returned the third portion the manager came to talk to me! Even after the fourth grilled portion as requested, I gave up the quality of the meat that was terrible. They stuffed us a Belgian beer down our throats for R $ 60! , because I went to answer the phone and the Italians ordered a beer and brought the most expensive one! We spent over R $ 200 per person to eat very badly! It's not even worth it, not even for the folklore for tourists!\n",

      "When we arrived at the hotel and on the phone everything seemed wonderful, but on the first day we were aware of the terrible stay we would have.The hotel's E DONA manager is often blaming the staff for what happens at the hotel, who are often just following the hotel's orders.ON THE FIRST DAY she AGGESIVELY knocked on the door of my room, AND OF ALL THE OTHER GUESTS, when we were sleeping at the end of the afternoon to ask who was smoking, she was ignorant, impolite and clueless ... punching the door TWICE until the person opens !!! can't!on the night of 12/31 we left for new year and left a bottle of whiskey 21 years old in my room and the next day when i woke up they had consumed about 20% of its contents, NO ATTITUDE WAS TAKEN, I communicated to the reception and NOTHING.I traveled with my boyfriend's family, we were 25 people at the hotel and REFUSED to heat up the children's meals and babysitters in the hotel's microwave, REASON: I WILL LEAVE THE MICROWAVE WITH FOOD SMELL. and the manager left a paper for the employee with the message and reason for the ban, which I saw. being that it had allowed the use of the same for this purpose.Whenever we asked for cutlery or plates it was confusing because it DIDN'T. when there was only 1.employees are unresponsive, fake and EXTREMELY EDUCATED, do not even try to give a towel when asked. say no !!we witnessed an employee speaking ill of family members.On the website there is a photo of snacks in the pool, however: YOU CANNOT EAT IN THE POOL.The manager only allows the pool to be used until 5 pm and said that the firefighters had prohibited the extension of the schedule, but we called the firefighters and found that it was LIE !!!!My aunt asked to buy 15 aguas and the employee said: I can't because we only have 7. and my aunt said she would buy at 7 then, and again he replied: I can't sell him at 7 because we only have 7 and we can't be without.What it looks like is that the manager and DONA want to implement the rules of her house in the hotel, submitting guests to their wishes and rules.If you don't want to ruin your vacation don't go to this hotel !!!NOTE 0!\n",
      "I was treated very well by Cássio.I know 3 restaurants, the two in Bsb and the one in João Pessoa. All very good.\n",

      "The Pituba bar restaurant is very nice, but the staff was a bit distraught, it seems that they are not very prepared to serve ... we were disappointed, because on a Friday at 9 pm, there was no crab anymore, not living up to the name of the House. The atmosphere is pleasant and relaxed, but unfortunately sinned in the service\n"

Creperie and well frequented bar.Very attentive waiters!The crepe didn't take long and was well prepared and tasty.The price is salty and worth for the whole, not only for the crepe.Indoor parking is only allowed for customers arriving until 7:00 pm, but there is a valet at the entrance if there are no vacancies. The location is good and is inside a gallery.I recommend the visit.\n",
      "The menu lacked a lot. The attendant girl seemed half lost, half I don't care. Very beautiful environment, but the menu deserves to be improved and the staff trained. It could be an excellent option for guests and visitors.\n",
      "The Greek restaurant is a great restaurant if you want to eat with the family, but it is very crowded, you will probably take a huge line, but it won't take long. The food is super varied and tasty, ranging from Italian food to fish, the most diverse salads, meat of all kinds, in short, very good!

      "When we arrived in Maceio, I heard a lot about the Emperor donates to Cameroon, and obviously I needed to come and see. We chose the main dish of the house, which is the famous shrimp gum.It's very different and it's delicious, but you have to like cheese a lot, because the dish has 04 different types of cheese and a lot of shrimp, that's the best part.They charge R $ 6.00 per person for artistic cover plus the service fee. When I went, I only paid for the cover charge and chose not to pay the service fee, as I found it absurd to pay the cover charge per person plus the service charge.\n",
      "Lousy service, poorly educated people who shouldn't work with a business that deals directly with the public, as they lack the education to deal with people. Poor quality pizza!\n",

      "I'm a fan and a little knowledgeable about Japanese cuisine and yesterday I was taken aback with some versions of Japanese dishes. Missoshiro without miso, was one of those pearls. The thing was more like Grandma's soup. Too many hot-rolls and rolled fish. Very compact and bland rice.The service was reasonable and the prices compatible with the product offered.I honestly don't come back and I don't recommend it either.\n",

Valet parking. Good drinks. Worth it.\n",
      "For those looking for a place to eat kebabs after work this is the place. Good cost benefit, skewers well served and always accompanied by cassava without extra cost. Honest prices and a wide variety of dishes, serving other dishes besides skewers.\n",
      "Best beef from SP, good variety on the menu, an extensive wine list and the atmosphere, which is always inviting. I was with a group of more than 10 people, and we were very well received, attentive and helpful service.I also liked the starters: Meat and Cheese Empanadas, in addition to the beer always being cold.I recommend it for families, groups, friends or even a romantic dinner.\n",
      "Our favorite baked pastry from Porto Alegre !! The shrimp with curd is excellent! And it's not expensive, good value for money 👌🏽\n",
      "Good menu and tapioca well stuffed and get ready quickly. At the new address, the order picking system can be confusing when the place is full. Mirrors and glass were fogged up (need attention). Negative point for açaí juice that is very watery.\n",

      "We cannot deny that the dishes at Gulliver Mar are well served and well made, even though the food is not the best, the atmosphere is great, the view is beautiful and the waiter who served me was incredibly friendly and attentive. I don't think the food is worth the price it is charged.\n",
      "I went to Goiânia shopping and decided to have a happy hour in the outback. We were answered however for the order to be placed we had to call the waiter several times. At the entrance Australian bread was on the table and it fell on the bench .. I asked the waiter to make the exchange, he took it and returned with the same bread. I was very unhappy because I go outback and had never had this experience. In addition, the draft beer mug was at room temperature and not as cold as usual.\n",
      "High spirits bar, with live music. Very tasty shrimp soup. However, when the bar was full, the service left something to be desired. Every now and then we were looking for someone to bring us a beer!\n",
      "Well-conditioned and cozy place, drinks and tasty dishes. My only complaint is because of the band that played on Karaoke Day: the sound of the instruments was very loud and people's voices barely appeared, and when we asked to raise the microphone one of the members of the band simply ignored it.\n",
      "I spent the day at Hibiscus with friends. The place is beautiful and has access to the sea. I took my SUP board and I had no problem. The food is good and the price is similar to the restaurants in the area. Only the service is a bit disruptive (they exchange orders or forget). But it's worth knowing 👏🏻🏄‍♀️😍\n",
      "I would say excellent when compared to the rest of the city. Good service (finally) and quality. approximately R $ 35 per head is spent. Tip on Saturdays, feijoada.\n",
      "Sum of practicality and perfection. Quick and well executed meals. Perfect setting for executive lunches and festive and family dinners.\n",
      "The low price for sushi buffet attracts, but it is not worth it. Cold pieces, with little fish and a lot of rice and they all seemed to have the same taste - from the fridge.As for the hot dishes, also disappointing ... bad yakissoba, chicken with ginger had sooo much sugar in the sauce, unbalanced flavors. Anyone who has eaten Japanese food for some time will probably not like it.\n",
      "The dishes are large and serve more than 1 person. in fact we shared each dish for 3 people and all served very well. lots of seafood options.\n",
      "For spice lovers, the restaurant's menu is very tasty.Daily has 2 options of dishes, which includes dessert and juice.Be sure to try the non-alcoholic appetizer that is offered at the entrance as a courtesy.Don't be alarmed by the amount of food on the plate. You will find that there is little food, but it is not.Surprise yourself!\n",

      "I really like the beer, the snacks and the high quality service. I will be back for sure, good taste\n",
      "With a great location, near the lighthouse of the bar, the restaurant is crowded. We went around 18:00 and it was full. There was no employee to indicate a table, so we sat down at the first one we found. The best option would be the balcony, but it was crowded. The service was slow to occur. A waiter, when called, literally frowned, shook his head and went straight. Another employee was more friendly and looked for someone to assist us. But the family that arrived shortly afterwards left frustrated for not being attended to. We ordered shrimp moqueca, which was really delicious, but I suggest they add a salad to accompany it. The dish costs R $ 85.00 and was served with pirao, rice and beans. Despite the service, it was worth it.\n",
      "End of year and I couldn't stop writing about this magical place. When I started attending I saw that all the customers were friends. Do you know that bar where everyone knows each other? Are you comfortable?I feel special here. Sandra and Carol are just wonderful.Attentive, friendly, happy.I also want to thank the people behind the scenes, whom I don't always see.I think I already ate the entire menu. Everything delicious. Escondidinho, the sausages the dumplings and the feijoada that makes anyone leave the regime without feeling guilty. Thank you for letting me be part of that family. Kisses and a great 2017\n",

      "Typical Italian cuisine is well represented in Barra by Ettore. A cozy atmosphere with several options of pasta and also meat. The wine list is also interesting and there is the option to have only one glass. The restaurant has tables outside, in the center and also a more reserved internal environment.\n",

      "The location is incredible, right on the lake, well decorated and comfortable, but the food and service are terrible. The food is of low quality, I already had 2 experiences at the house, both very bad. The value is high, not worth the visit at all.\n",
      "At the Emporium Cheese and Wine Confraria, I went and I am always well attended, the staff are always in a good mood and with great attention. The options are great, the price could improve a little, to be quite honest. The space in the background is very cozy and a little limited in places that does not diminish the potential of the place. It's very good ! It is worth checking.\n",
      "Let's face it, the Iguatemi mall has a very bad food court and that crowded mall, nobody deserves it, lol.Escape to the back of the mall and go to Le Jazz!Very French, good music, good options on the menu, good drinks and wines.I just missed more meatless options (there are none on the main courses !!!)Great option if you are in traffic in the region, I stop the car and enjoy a jazz and an aperitif until the chaos passes. Super recommended !!!!\n",
      "Sargent is the ideal place for that meeting with friends or happy hour with co-workers. R. Quintino Bocaiúva's new house maintains the good mood that existed at the previous address and with the advantage of having more space.

      "The day we visited Hibiscus the day was horrible early in the morning, we got rain and we didn't get to enjoy the place very much. However, when the sun came out, everything became more beautiful. You could get a sense of the beauty of the place. A negative point is the expensive Day Use price, of all the Beach Clubs we visited, was the most abusive, and there is no reason to have such a high price. Lunch and drinks were also expensive, but the food was very tasty, so it was worth paying. The price of lunch does not panic so much, taking into account that all bars on the coast of Alagoas have more or less this price range. I recommend for the beauty of the place, but for the value it is not so worth it.\n",

For the main course I really like the Greek prawns, the shrimp risotto and a grilled fish that comes with vegetables (I don't remember the name now).

The food is one of the most expensive in the neighborhood, but it is eaten very well. You find everything, even lobster. Fast service. Service note 10. I recommend. It is a place Iara came alone.

As the restaurant is in the Docks, there is a group that presents itself on a sliding platform, there is an excess of noise.We ordered two bottles of beer with typical flavors. When the waiter arrived with a glass of beer on the table, my husband said it was not what we had asked for. The boy got angry, said that was the request, left the glass on the table and went to question the other one who had made the note. He returned to the table and asked indignantly, Aren't you really going to want the draft beer?My husband argued that it was not what we wanted. He left and returned with the manager, who politely cleared up the misunderstanding. Even so, the waiter didn’t conform, didn’t come back to our table,What's wrong with an exchanged order? Doesn't that happen often? He was very inconvenient and impatient ...We noticed that the boys worked with a closed face, but they were not unpleasant like that.\n",

For those who like seafood it is a very good variety and the dishes are delicious.The extremely cold draft beer and in addition to a quality live music with a repertoire of MPB that leaves you with no desire to leave.I recommend with my eyes closed.\n",
      "My rating is exclusively for French bread, the best in town, in my opinion.\n",
      "We went to the one on the Orla, a very tasty cozy place and reserved for a family dinner, we expected more from the shrimp gum, I found the portion small, I didn't have the opportunity to try the Shrimp Pajucara which seems to be very good, the second time we came back to the Emperor the first was in 2012 and now we are back in 2015, I would return again.\n",
      "The main dish was not the best I've ever eaten in Salvador, but the ambience, the starter (bruschetas with a colorful bread and cheese type kingdom) and the lemon juice, were very worth the experience.I would return, mainly on a Sunday when in June, there was a very lively forró in the place!\n",
      "The first time I visited Fortaleza, I was amazed by the Crocobech Complex, not so much for its restaurant, but for all the services. the city of Fortaleza, which shows chaos in traffic, urban cleaning and especially security on Av Beira Mar, where tourists transit and I had the displeasure of having been robbed.\n",
      "Very delicious food, typical dishes, pleasant atmosphere, clean and quiet, well located and easily accessible.\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, good service and delicious pizza. It's not very cheap, I advise you to be willing to spend a little more, but it's worth it!\n",
      "The environment has a nice decoration, the space is small, with few tables, but it is cozy. The hamburgers are delicious.\n",
      "Beautiful environment, on the day we went there was no queue then, the food was tasty, only the pasta from the husband's spaguet that was well cooked and pasta should come to the point, but it is not lacking in other units!Watch Fabrício very kind!\n",
      "Excellent options of dishes, fair prices, tailored service and super pleasant environment. They made mistakes in my daughter's children's plate but stopped charging, which was very fair! This is our second visit and we will definitely be back more often!\n",
      "A good place to grab a quick pizza with family and children. Many flavor options that even leave doubts when choosing! It is worth checking!\n",
      "Perfect for those who are on the run and want something fast!The ice cream is strategically located outside, ideal for a hot day ... It is worth trying the açaí cone !!\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere in the square of the red river. Heineken cold, goodCustomer service and serve skewers. Great to have a cold and have a chat. It was crowded\n",
      "Del Popollo is an Italian food restaurant, with excellent pasta dishes like Pizzas, Lasagna and even that steak. The restaurant has the appearance of a castle with a rustic atmosphere.I recommend the visit.\n",
      "The location is cool, the sidewalk being the best place to stay. It has beers from the world. And great Australian and German food.\n",
      "I love this restaurant. I go every 2 monthsNovelty:1- koh hompha: entrance with prawns wrapped in a cone with delicious sauce2- tal mahal: delicious dessert\n",
      "Cozy place, good service, good pasta and pizza options.It has a cold buffet table for entry and a very varied wine list.It is worth checking\n",
      "The atmosphere is good, the food is very good, but the service is a little time consuming and a little distant. But it pays off.\n",
      "The place does not only have pizza, but also other dishes. The pizza is very stuffed and I can say that it is the best pizzeria in town.\n",
      "Very good restaurant. Very pleasant environment. Very good and varied food, with several options of very tasty dishes. Good service.\n",
      "Restaurant with wonderful food. The internal decoration and external architecture are beautiful, especially the waterfall on the side (made of aluminum in the form of scales). The service is very good! Best restaurant I met in João Pessoa!\n",
      "Without a doubt, the shrimp pastry is wonderful, but for me, the seafood broth is irresistible. It doesn't matter if the heat is on, it's my first request. First right, because there is no way to eat food only in this bar.\n",
      "Sophisticated and elegant atmosphere, however with regard to the rotation is a trick. After eating the plate of vegetables, the sausage rotation started, when the meat started to be served, it was only because I called what seemed to me to be the manager and told him that I would leave without serving any kind of meat. . The meat served was hard and extremely salty. A pity, total disappointment.\n",
      "Delicious food and friendly service; attentive waiters ... not to mention the location. I will be back for sure. Best dessert of life!\n",
      "It is a charming place, in a basement next to the Mercado da Rua 3. The waiters are mature and helpful, which helps to compose the atmosphere of charm. But a warm affection for a restaurant that is almost the age of the city explains the goodwill of the regulars. The lasagna pasta, made at home, cooks too much. Perhaps to guarantee agility in the service, the dishes are ready waiting for the order. You have to hire a detective to find cheese in the lasagna. The four cheese penne considers sour cream one of the cheeses, a very great poetic license. The sauce as a whole, except for a chunk of gorgonzola here and another there, looks ready, with no personality. Parmesan at the table is hideous bran, as well as olive oil diluted in soy oil. In addition, the house does not accept cards. Anyway, if you have no affective relationship with the place and only evaluate the food, the restaurant is quite ordinary. One leaves, out of curiosity, and leaves without the desire to return.\n"

      "Super complete dinner, excellent menu, succulent and tasty fish. Service very well done by the staff, there was no shortage of items on our table at any time. In particular, I would like to congratulate waiter Gildo for the excellent service!\n",
      "The best codfish cake I've ever eaten in Goiânia, was at Glória. In addition to a cold beer and a super tasty atmosphere next to the Civil Forum of the West Sector. It is a very well attended happy hour, mainly of servers and magistrates. The snacks are delicious and the service is very good.\n",
      "The atmosphere is pleasant and welcoming. The extremely attentive and helpful attendant, grade ten. The dishes have small portions, French style and the prices are high for what they serve. However, they are well presented and tasty. Cost x benefit does not pay.\n",
      "I arrived, I liked the atmosphere, the service was good, however, the hamburger I ordered came very bad (I may not have been lucky), it seemed that they had forgotten the meat on the plate ...\n",
      "Anyone who knows Italy knows that the common mark of gastronomy there is simplicity with good ingredients and that is exactly what you find here. My husband and our friends ate a special cut that takes part of the diaper, it was great, at the right point. I ate a very good lamb! And the surprise was the creamy polenta with pecorino that I asked to accompany the lamb: divine !!!!\n",
      "Barranco is a classic from Porto Alegre. It has easy and paid parking.For starters: assemble your salad, served in the cart and get a refill. Taste the potato salad (mayonnaise)The meats are well served and made with little invention - picanha, sausage, chicken. Mixed skewers are also recommended.A good tip: tenderloin covered with cheese. Great combination!Dessert: I suggest papaya cream or pudding. A little expensive when compared to the price of the dishes.\n",
      "The service leaves something to be desired, but the crab is a show of the ball. Better than many name restaurants around town. Ordering a double crab is the best option, but while you wait, you can order some cold beers to make small talk.I will return for another experience.\n",
      "Before preparation the waiter shows you the fish or seafood that will be prepared, or if you prefer, you can choose,\n",
      "The house arrived at the mall with all the characteristics of being the best option in the place, but from the beginning it cannot correct its mistakes.Dishes arrive cold, raw meats (even if I ordered them well done), the smell of fried food exhales in the room, a dirty glass to serve you and now I heard on social media that a client received her fillet of roasted meat with the adhesive seal of the refrigerator supplier together. Worse it was not even Friboi to value the product !!!!The service of the waiters is also terrible, you need to ask a favor to be served.The variety at the emporium is what improves the place, even with very steep prices, perhaps justified by being inside the mall ...\n",
      "The new Coco Bambu dish is to be eaten praying! The dishes are very well served. And Milton's service was a top 10! Whenever I go I am very well attended.\n",

      "The Arnaudo bar is located in the heart of Santa Teresa, amid the mansions and tram tracks. Simple and delicious bar, with quality northeastern food and VERY well served: an individual dish, which costs around 45 reais, makes it easy for two hungry people to eat. Only the service that is not there these things ...\n",
      "We ordered two dishes where one of them was too sour for my taste. And the mashed potatoes looked like mashed potatoes. Tasteless . The other dish was very good.\n",
      "The main attraction of the restaurant is the balcony overlooking the lake and the third bridge. The restaurant is well set up and the service is competent and fast. The shrimp dishes are full: lots of rice, cream, cheese, sun-dried tomatoes ... plenty of ingredients. And they serve four adults easily, which makes the restaurant an even economical option.Nothing special or new in flavor. Food for the masses.\n",
      "I already knew another Tantra unit in Itaim and I recently met the Tatuapé unit.The quality is the same, same foods, same service, all great and delicious.It is very worthwhile to eat different meats, try recipes and have fun. The atmosphere is very pleasant, the only problem is that at dinner it ends up filling up. Ideal to book and arrive early.I recommend going for lunch too.\n",
      "The snacks are delicious, well served, but very light. Differentiated and creative recipes. Milkshake is also very tasty. Pleasant environment.\n",
      "This small restaurant specializes in food prepared with organic ingredients. A great option are the tasty artisanal pizzas made with a thin and wholemeal dough, but the menu also has other dishes, such as risottos. The internal space is rustic and small (in the mezzanine the ceiling is quite low), but there is more space on the outdoor tables in the front patio, next to the sidewalk. The price is right considering the quality and care in preparing the dishes.\n",
      "Starting with the restaurant owners who are always present, all the service goes impeccably.Attention from the meter, the waiters and the whole team makes the atmosphere warm, pleasant and with a personalized touch.The style of the restaurant follows the modern style that at the same time contrasts with the rustic wooden details of the pilasters and windows. With a huge stained glass on the top floor, customers have a pleasant feeling of space and visibility of the trees that surround the establishment.With the menu full of options, you can't help but find a dish that appeals to you every time. The right seasoning is a great visual presentation.I recommend it for sure.Great for couples, business and friends.Linguiini with seafood is delicious and risotto with mandioquinha.\n",
      "Great place to go with the family, excellent service, average prices, the pizzas are wonderful.\n",
      "Nice restaurant with live music. Dishes well prepared and well served with good service.\n",

As always, I was able to count on the special assistance of the maître Carlinhos.Our dishes were divine, congratulations to the kitchen which is impeccable.Be sure to try the prosecco shrimp.\n",
      "The pizzas are good and with thick dough in my opinion, but with a good price, the service takes a little time\n",
      "An excellent restaurant with well served dishes, nice flavors, differentiated service, an excellent option in Maceió.\n",
      "I enjoyed the atmosphere, especially in the part near a hanging garden. At the weekend it was very crowded and we were served at an ideal time in front of the scene. We asked for the combined number 174. Yuki Premium (R $ 129.90) -combined with 22 pieces plus 13 slices of sashimi. In general the special sushi combo is simple without many different ingredients, so I find it relatively expensive. The quality in general is very good and the food is tasty. We ordered a strawberry nevada without alcohol (R $ 17.90) to accompany it.\n",
      "The restaurant offers a complete pasta menu. The lasagna is second to none! But I've heard that the pasta is not to be desired ... The only downside is the long line. It's good to get there early if you don't want to wait too long ...\n"

The sushi is very different and tasty, it's that gourmet japa, and the drinks are very good, I had a delicious Apple Martini. I really liked the environment, super modern, the service is excellent. The house was packed, we waited a few minutes to get a table, and even though the food arrived super fast, the orders were taken promptly without delay even with the large flow and the waiters are very kind and helpful.I will definitely be back!The value is not the cheapest, but for the quality, service, and dishes that are offered it is worth it.\n",

      "Pizza with too much baked dough, stuffing thrown on top of the dough and cold.Bad service. He says he doesn't charge 10% and comes to the account.A deception\n",
      "Fried fish or shrimp of various types. Lamaru serves several options of dishes and has a good price, they need to improve the service, but it is worth it.\n",
      "Excellent service, the quality is the same as the others in the chain. It leaves nothing to be desired in any of the dishes. The waiter informed us of a new ginger-based rib sauce that I recommend. In addition to the cold beer, the caipifrutas are wonderful, worth a try.\n",

      "I frequent this pizzeria weekly. Wide location and easy parking, serving friendly and very well made pizzas. However, the other day I decided to order a gnocchi au gratin on the menu. It was a great surprise. Tasty and service on the spot. I recommend!\n",
      "Restaurant half shed, half hangar, half shipyard, pleasant and comforting, with high ceilings and retro decor, formed by an antique refrigerator, wood stove, record player and radio from the 1940s. A delight for the weekends, to awaken longing for freedom lazy childhood. Chef Marcelo Gonçalves is a delicacy expert with a Swiss background. I recommend the starter of bean soup with poached egg and, as a side dish, the fillet burger without bread with gorgonzola, fried onion, potatoes is inexplicable (good) barbecue sauce.\n",
      "If you are waiting for your flight schedule. For sure visit the Pub, good beer and even better food. I recommend the pork ribs with rapadura sauce and farofa. No doubt you will not regret it. Also try the beer tasting board :)\n",
      "The Beloved really lives up to the name! Delicious dishes, impeccable service and an incredible view! It's impossible not to love!We started with prawn chips for starter - and I must say it was one of the best starters I've ever eaten - followed by octopus with black rice and lobster with maturi risotto. Seafood made to perfection, octopus at the right point, melting in your mouth!As a dessert we chose the guava cheesecake, which is more of a souffle. The super creamy cheese contrasted well with the sour guava ice cream. To match, we ordered a very mild Chilean Chardonnay.The bill, for two people, was almost 500 reais, but it was worth every penny!\n",
      "I love the atmosphere and food at this restaurant. I recommend the caprese salad, the carpaccio, the ricotta ravioli, the apple and lemon pie. The reserved environment we stayed in was very cozy.\n",
      "Le Bateau Ivre restaurant is a piece of southern France in the capital Gaucha. Many options on the menu is a great wine list. To finish the dessert, the Creme Brulee Caramelized with a blowtorch on your table by Chef Gerard Durand. The service in the house is perfect.\n",

      "Overall I really like the restaurant! The food is good, but it could be better considering the values. However, I think that in the last few months the restaurant has fallen, the dishes are not as tasty as before. The service from the waiters is very good and the atmosphere is super pleasant! Anyway recommend!\n",
      "Typical dishes, decorated environment and very good service. In addition to the restaurant, there is a space where only Forró Tradicional is played.Complete stating that the prices are honest, despite the high frequency of tourists.\n",
      "I went to Applebee's at Shopping Morumbi for a corporate happy hour ... the place is packed from 5:30 pm, due to the absolute lack of reasonable options in the region ..... despite that we were very well attended and the promotion 2 x 1 of happy hour makes salty prices inviting ...The seviche (fish and seafood) was very good but the marguerita (2 x 1, remember!) Was made with that mix of ready marguerita, typical of those who don't know how to prepare the real drink ... but the visit was worth it worth and recommend ....\n",
      "I went with my boyfriend, because some friends had already indicated us. Honestly, for those who like comfort, good service, good menu (at least something that runs away from chips and pizza) and want to have a nice chat with your company, this is definitely not the place. We went once and we don't intend to go back!In addition to not eating well, not being served well, our bill was absurd to expensive compared to what was consumed. The place is cramped and very noisy.For a post-beach or group of friends to drink a beer, it may be, but nothing more.\n",
      "For those who like Japanese food, here has no freshness, in the carvery you eat what you can handle, everything wonderful, very neat, delicious, great service, I recommend it to everyone\n",
      "Although it was listed that it wouldn't open on Sunday, they were open during lunch. Until 15h.They had no juices but they told us they will soon.Nice variety of beers, despite not being familiar with the subject. Escaping the big commercial brands and emphasizing the gourmet.We ordered a chorizo ​​that was tasty. They are very rigid in relation to the point of the meat. And there's no use wanting to give your point! They decide the sweet spot, more for the past.We also ordered a Burger with mushrooms.If you are pregnant and do not eat rare meat, reconsider the visit for after you are released in relation to meat. The waiter was super attentive and asked to change the point of the burger but they don't usually do that.\n",
      "Roxy is one of the most pleasant places with the best (creative) menu in Belém. Despite the surname Bar, for me, it is a restaurant. Recommended dishes: Filet Sadam Hussein, Peixe Dira Paes and cat food Gary Cooper. But to taste the delicacies on the menu, you have to be very patient. There is no parking and getting a spot on the street is a difficult task. As difficult as getting a seat in the restaurant itself. On any day of the week, the lines are long. The sooner you arrive at Roxy (and it's early around 7pm), the less chance of getting bored with the waiting time.\n"

      "Lunch almost every day away from home. But I don't give up the homemade food. In this restaurant there are many options. The menu is extremely rich and varied. When we talk about this in a self service restaurant, by kilo we get the impression that something would be desired. However, to my surprise everything I put on the plate was divine to my taste.The pork, the picanha, the typical Arab dishes like cigar, kibbeh were wonderful.I made a pawn dish and was also surprised by the price. Super fair.Very recommended!\n",
      "I really enjoyed the chicken and catupiry pizza from Amigos Pizzaria. They do home delivery. The atmosphere of the pizzeria is very pleasant.\n",

Even though it was Monday, and after 9.50 pm, we were very well attended by João Paulo. Very pleasant experience !! The dishes were delicious and were served quickly. The live music was a special treat!\n",
      "The staff, with the exception of the last waiter who served me is not very prepared, seem to be in a hurry for you to leave! You can barely talk because the waiters are on top to take out dishes, before we're even finished. Attention is good, but not in excess!The environment is excellent and very clean.The food was cold and not very varied (Humaitá's is much better) but, what I ate was delicious, it only lacked a little seasoning.It has traditional Minas Gerais food, grills and crepes (also with little variety), in addition to the candy buffet, which is very diverse but not so tasty.They should invest in staff training and see the possibility of keeping food warm or changing it more often. Although I did not find the price for buffets in general to be expensive, I was not satisfied with the cost / benefit, my son who was the birthday boy also did not like our choice.\n",
      "Very good mutton served in this restaurant. The rest of the food is common, but the lamb and the service are very good.\n",
      "Look ... I know some restaurants specializing in seafood in Brazil abroad ... but without a doubt, this one has arguably the best shrimp dishes I've ever eaten in my life.Congratulations to the chef !!\n",
      "You will certainly not be able to eat everything you have at the buffet, there are many options, all tasty and well seasoned. I like the carne de sol with cream, melted butter cheese, baião de dois and green beans. The desserts are also very good, petit gateaux with melted crumb as it should be. The environment is beautiful and with a Northeastern theme, it has kids space and good service.\n",
      "Second time I have lunch there. Beautiful restaurant, elegant decor. Variety of typical dishes (I love rice with pequi), meats, seafood, several options of salads and vegetables. Table of homemade sweets is fantastic! About 5 types of dulce de leche, fruit candies in syrup, candied, etc. Wonderful!\n",

The place is extremely cozy, the wine list is exceptional and the dishes are so good that they always make you want to come back! It is that type of restaurant that is always the first option when we are in doubt where to go. It is good for both business meetings, romantic dinner and family gatherings.\n",
      "Excellent price for the quality of the pizzas. In many expensive pizzerias in Goiânia the same quality is found in this place. Made in a traditional oven, and the fillings are of good quality. Great cost-benefit ratio! It's really worth it!\n",

      "Parking spaces at the door. Hostess takes you to the table. Air-conditioned environment (outside 32 degrees ... inside 20). Good distance between tables and I was able to choose where to sit. During the week, lunch time, it is quieter. I already say that there is no fabric napkin ... the pattern deserves it (they will say it is sustainability ... I will say it is silly economy). Hyper-attentive waiter. I drank lemon juice (I was going to drive) and I had my sweetener ... many times in Sampa I don't have it. I looked at the wine list: good. There are varied natural juices. Elegant glasses, cutlery and plates. At the beginning we ordered a crab cone, but it had crayfish and shrimp bruscheta. We eat moqueca: 400 g of shrimp. Great bathroom, fragrant, ventilated, with dental floss, fragrant soap and delicate and very well decorated paper. Honest price (I would pay maybe more in an industrialized bamboo sampa coconut). Congratulations Maceió.\n",

      "Excellent restaurant. The service is great, the food is divine! Dishes are beautiful, well served and very tasty! Great variety and dishes! The restaurant is always full, but maintains good service and orders don't take long! It's really worth it!\n",

      "We went with a group to the recently opened Tragga of Vogue Square, which arrived with good fame from its headquarters in Botafogo, on a Saturday night with a queue. Then the problems started, the line took a long time and a group passed in front of us, because the receptionist curled up with the lists and commented with the hostess who takes the customer to the tables. A person in my group listened and complained to the pair, who impassively denied what he had just said. We overcame what happened and finally sat down, but the orders arrived cold and only one meat arrived hot. The waiter, very attentive, asked if the order came correctly and if everything was satisfactory. We complained about the meat being cold and he immediately took it to repair the fault. They took a long time to come back and we need to remind another meat waiter, because ours was getting paid for a big table with many people. The meats came back quite well done, almost seared and no longer to the point, as they had been commanded. We practically only eat the side dishes. The price of a mini Coca-cola (a small glass) at R $ 8.50 also drew attention. It was worth the experience to never return. Considering that within a radius of 3 kilometers it is the third Argentine steak restaurant, as it has Corrientes 348 in Rio Design Barra and La Cabrera in Barra Shopping, Tragga is not even close.\n"

      "The carvery is very diverse: sashimis (white fish, tuna and salmon), teppans (salmon, anchovy or saint peter) and the other classic carvery (tempura, guiozas, hot rolls, nigiri, uramakis, temakis, hosomakis, shimeji, etc. ).The attendants are friendly and the houses are usually full, which causes a certain air of mess, however, everything works correctly.\n",
      "I thought it was worth the gourmet hot dogs, the price ranges from R $ 13.00 to R $ 15.00 and comes with french fries and maçaricado cheese. I found it very tasty and with several options.\n",
      "Terrible chicken with brown sauce, cold chicken, watery sauce and not at all traditional. In addition bad service.\n",
      "The restaurant exceeds the expectations of those who choose the place judging its location. the dishes are very tasty and very well prepared. It was a very pleasant surprise\n",
      "We spent a very happy time celebrating David's birthday! Moment to be kept in memory !!!!\n",

      "Excellent restaurant .. It is inside a mall.First-rate service ..hearty dishes, fresh seafood.Delicious ambience.\n",
      "The atmosphere is a little confusing because it is a mixture of restaurant, bar, bakery / confectionery, so I found it a little noisy. The service is good and the food very tasty, I ordered a pumpkin risotto with shrimp that was delicious, considering the price (35 reais), I found it to be an excellent cost-benefit. I recommend!\n",
      "I went into this restaurant a few years ago and I noticed a sharp drop in the overall quality of the dishes. The chickpea and eggplant pastes were very bad, the bread seemed industrialized, without softness and old. The hot dishes seemed too Brazilian, losing much of their originality and why not say flavor. Despite the good service it was a bad experience and I have no reason to return to this restaurant. The difference in quality of this restaurant, in terms of food, for the 2 other competitors in the city is striking and even so there was a good movement. It seems that the gaucho public is getting less demanding.\n",
      "Without a doubt, the location is one of the great attractions. There's nothing like sitting on the short wall, enjoying the view over a drink with a crab cone. Unfortunately, prices have increased a lot recently, but it remains an irresistible program. The restaurant above the bar is also great. Ask for a table with a view, but be prepared to wait a long time, because on weekends the line is usually long.\n",

      "The Macapá cocoa show is all good.Wonderful service and chocolates are not even mentioned.Very good.\n",
      "We spent about 40 minutes waiting for excellent service. I can't even judge and say whether the service was good or bad, because it didn't exist. After a week in Belém, Conbu was the first disappointment. Ten reais to park on the sidewalk, plus 4 for the boat crossing (old, dirty and uncomfortable) to get to the restaurant and LITERALLY have to search (take it out of the pile, load it and put it in the chosen place in the restaurant environment) the tables and chairs. When inquiring about the service, other customers (and us) received (the) answer: It will take time.We gave up and left without eating.I won't be back and I don't recommend it.\n",
      "Well, to be honest I expected more! The place is comfortable, very good for a dinner for two, family and friends. In my opinion, the food is not so great, for the price nothing so surprising! It is worth knowing, and drawing your own conclusions. In my case, it was worth the experience, but it is not a place I would go back to because I loved the food, for example. The service is really good, the waiters are very attentive, and the place is very well attended.\n",
      "I think it was the first place to offer differentiated products for parties (lactose free, gluten free). All very good\n",
      "House of good meat, very good atmosphere, very good service, wine list too. But a very weak cover for the house level, poor bar with several options on the menu and lack of drinks in the bar as there is no dry vermouth to add to the end for a Dry Martini, it has to improve, the clientele deserves\n",
      "Great service, all fast and very tasty. Attentive waiters and owner.We ordered the executive menu and were very surprised to have lighter options.The salad with avocado and chicken is very good.\n",
      "Great option for happy hour, lunch or dinner!Fair prices, tasty dishes and a relaxed atmosphere.It is recommended to arrive early, the place is quite crowded.\n",
      "I went with my fiancee. I didn't know the restaurant, I saw a photo on Facebook of a friend who went and got interested. The place is super cozy. I preferred to stay outside to enjoy the experience more, but it was very hot. The food is excellent. It came fast and it tasted great and looked great. I ordered a fish stew with shrimp. I don't know the exact name of the dish. At the beginning I ordered a cheese patel with cream cheese. It didn't take even 5 minutes and it was very good. I found the price a bit steep, but for the place and the food, it's worth it.\n"

The service is very good, orders come out fast (even when the restaurant is full) and the food is very tasty. Order the classic combination of Chop Suey Rice, Shredded Meat with Onion and Chicken on the Plate with Fries. Located on one of Natal's main avenues, it has parking and a park for children. As with any Chinese restaurant, you leave Thin San stinking of food.\n",
      "Be sure to order the portion of cod cakes (perfect) and it also comes with a very good pepper sauce. For main course: lagareido cod (noble part of the fish served with potatoes, boiled eggs and olives). Great options of Port wines. For dessert, ice cream sundae.\n",

I think he's in the wrong profession.\n",
      "My friends and I went to dine in among friends of Boa Viagem. I found the environment very beautiful, all white and with a calm light. The ambient sound was a little loud. The service was respectful, but a little cold. The food did not excite. I also found the restaurant to be little focused on local food, even though it had a goat in its name. Anyway, a refined place, but without emotion.\n",
      "Despite the same themed decoration of the bar, the service and the glamor of the bar is somewhat lost in this unit. If your preference is for a bar, choose the one in Cidade Baixa.Although the food was good, there was a lack of enough waiters and my order was even taken wrong.\n",

I also thought the prices were salty ... in the end the waiter offered a cup of coffee, which we believed to be complimentary ... it wasn't, but we only found out when we received the bill. Finally, comparing it with other restaurants in the city of the same line, A Porteira left a lot to be desired ... it just wasn't more frustrating because of the view which is really beautiful ... but that we may have from any point of the Dike. Wouldn't go back ... a pity!\n",

He seemed lost, in a hurry and very unwilling to explain! We ordered Chef Jr Durski’s L'entrecote and to our surprise it wasn’t sold out! As there was not much meat option, we ordered a Super Premium Picanha and a Filé Argentino (Ribeye). The waiter said that by ordering the meat, we would have the right to choose one of the side dishes described on the menu and a type of sauce. I asked if the accompanying meat and sauce were included in the meat value and he said yes. We ordered the Fettuccine in butter and the mustard sauce for both. As soon as the dishes arrived, a disappointment! The Fettuccine (which it says is in butter) looked like a pasta cooked only in water, without salt, without any seasoning and the butter was only in the name. The dough was extremely sticky, horrible !!! A disappointment! The meat sincerely, very bland, soft, but nothing surprising, T Bone or any other piece of beef from Outback from 10 to 0. We ordered the green apple soda, which was not surprising, bland, tasteless of green apple! It looked like carbonated water! The only thing that really surprised us was the starter we asked for, a Smoked Leg Linguicinha (130gr) with a bread roll, farofa and chimichurri sauce. We asked for the bill, another waiter came to take the bill! When we check the bill, one more disappointment! I asked why the sauce was charged. Then he asked me the name of the waiter who had served us, said the name, and explained that this waiter who placed the orders, never said that the sauce was paid separately, in this case of Picanha Super Premium, very much for on the contrary, he stated that the two dishes that we had ordered would have directly asked for the accompaniment and the sauce, but he did not say that the sauce for this specific dish would be charged, and he said that it was included! Anyway, they charged an extra sauce, even with my complaint, they made no point of repairing the situation and at least an excuse for what happened! I did not pay the 10% of a bill of approximately 200.00, with 2 draft beer, 1 soda, a small sausage starter and two dishes! The waiter had no patience since the beginning to explain the dishes to present us what the house had to offer, since we didn't know the chain and we were in a very high expectation to know! Bad to pay 200.00 for a dinner with bad service and food! Disappointing! I intend not to return and for those who want to eat meat, I do not recommend!\n",

      "The environment is fantastic. At night there are screens with music clips and the acoustics are wonderful. It remains one of my favorite restaurants. The quantity and quality of the dishes have dropped, but there are some classic dishes that deserve applause. The desserts are great, great service. What I don't like is that it is in a bad place to park. It was a residential house and is behind big hotels. If there is an event on the Oraca de Aracaju, or if there is a lot of tourists, we have no parking space. Even so I recommend !!!!\n"

      "Good and clean typical Brazilian kilo restaurant. Serving yourself at the large and diverse buffet and you don't pay the weight of your plate.Good meat. Central position a few blocks from the Catete subway.\n",
      "After eight visits in the past two months, I was surprised by the discrepancy between some of the best and worst meals I have ever had. The lean menu usually indicates cohesion and a restaurant more committed to quality than quantity. At its best, it is impossible to be disappointed. The problem is that it all depends on the day. In one of the lunches, from gyosa to sushi rice, everything was overly salty. Other times, the fish seemed less fresh. The great frustration, however, is due to the service. Despite the casual and inviting atmosphere, the service is excessively mechanical, something that comes close to the robotic spontaneity of a telemarketer. At one of the lunches, I arrived with two 11:58 friends. The restaurant opens at noon. I asked to confirm, and I was told to wait outside while the employees talked. I don't want to seem precious, I just want to illustrate the lack of a certain sensitivity, something that goes beyond blindly obeying orders. Couldn't they let us sit down and offer something to drink in the 2 minutes left to open officially? At one of the dinners, I tried to taste some dishes, despite the lack of knowledge of some employees to explain. I took a risk and didn't like it. Neither the fish cheeks, which are difficult to eat as they are served, nor the pork noodle, which is actually made up of rubbery pork fat. I took a risk and I was wrong, my fault, no problem. But it is a little strange for a customer to return two whole dishes - even more considering the price of the two - without this drawing the attention of the service. I hope things get better, because the place is promising.\n",

We canceled the caipiroska and ordered the coca cola. ... Rodízio is pierced because it looks like a steakhouse and the meat from the sun only came to the table because we demanded of the guy who attended us when entering the restaurant and had told us that in the carvery there would be meat from the sun. Disappointing! I have great barbecue here in the South and I would even recommend the owner to send a barbecue to learn how to make a good barbecue.

The rereading of the chicken is phenomenal!The snacks are delicious and beautifully presented. Although a little expensive for the amount they are super worth it.

We went outside to the bigger tables, but it was cold. We asked again to be accommodated inside by joining a table, request again denied. We left the place for the arrogant service. We went to the takami, where, coincidence or not, we were offered to put together a table to better accommodate ourselves.I had a lot of expectations to get to know Lotus, but I was extremely disappointed with the arrogant service, which preferred us to go elsewhere than gather a table to better accommodate us.Only go if they are in multiples of 4!\n",

      "Regina's acarajé is very tasty. This is not your main board.He was the protagonist of a territorial dispute for the acarajé boards in Rio Vermelho.He chose to stay in this small space without much visibility.Clientele loyal to good service and flavor.\n",
      "Delicious food, good service, the dish does not divide, good service who wants to eat a good pasta is worth it.\n",
      "Surely this is the best hamburger in Fortaleza, the bread is tasty and the meat is very juicy. Worth it!!\n",

      "11 years ago I was in Natal on my honeymoon, and now we are returning with the children, and as I could not miss the dinner in the famous Natal restaurant in Cameroon, it has improved, expanded.

      "Good quality service (Eliomar👏👏👏), cozy atmosphere and tasty and abundant food. I'll be back soon\n",
      "Best restaurant in Manaus. Worth every penny it costs. It brings all the richness of Amazonian cuisine, including the forms of preparation, but with a lot of creativity and flavor.

      "I happened to enter the restaurant that is hidden behind a house under renovation in Higienópolis, next to the Shopping. Super charming !! I sat at 2 X on the balcony, since the inside is more disputed. Great food! A ravioli with shrimp and truffled olive oil to eat while kneeling. My mom ordered gnocchi, loved it and my husband the lobster. All cheap dishes to the standard of São Paulo and divine! Super recommend!\n",
      "One of the best burgers I've ever eaten, and the service then? I was very well attended by Maria Larícia, she made me taste a wonderful list 😂 I became a fan.\n",
      "We didn’t get to eat here, we went to another franchise, but as soon as we arrived we were very well attended and not because they didn’t have a rotation, they indicated their other restaurant that was nearby, and upon arriving at the other restaurant we were greeted by the manager who had already been informed we were arriving\n",
      "An excellent restaurant with Peruvian and Japanese cuisine. This restaurant is located in the Campo Grande shopping mall. Excellent service we were served by Caio, who explained exactly about the restaurant's dishes and drinks. Restaurant suitable for people who want to get out of sameness, and like a different and quality food. As a main dish I ate black rice there, very top and to finish a dessert called Suspiro Limeno. Another positive factor: the price. Great cost-benefit ratio. I wish that in my city there was such a restaurant. The hostesses are beautiful and very friendly.\n",
      "The best submarine and the best portions of the city are in a region known for its bars and old buildings in Curitiba\n",
      "beautiful place with a good balcony on the tip of the black beach and a very good weekly comedy show\n",
      "Strengths:1-Super nice location and environment2-good music3-attentive staff.Delicious 4-skewers, although time consumingNegative points:1- The music ends very early, around 10 pm.2-Billing system is per table, in the case of groups, the ideal would be individual command because I had no way of controlling what each one consumes and in the end, as I was responsible for the tables, I had to bear the loss.3-They do not make a reservation, I think they should do it, even the other branches do, as it appears on the website, except for Tijuca.\n",
      "Menu with several northeastern varieties, well served portions and in short delivery time. Variety of drinks too (beers, drinks, juices, whiskey ...). Very cool. Worth knowing. Fair price.\n",

      "Great! Cool place, with good background music and great service. The hamburgers are delicious and the Nutella milk shake is very, very good. The dishes come out fast and so the queue is not so long. For those who want to eat a real hamburger, without much invention, I highly recommend it. My husband and I love it.\n",
      "I went to the place with great expectation of eating the strawberry crepe with nutella, I ordered, but when the dish arrived (after a long delay), I came across the WORST crepe I have ever seen in my life. The chocolate passed away from being nutella and seemed to be of very bad quality, the strawberry actually looked more like a jelly in the dough with a very bitter taste. I couldn't eat more than a mouthful. DISAPPOINTING!\n"

      "I recently took my wife out to dinner at the Coco Bambu restaurant, located at the Iguatemi mall in Porto Alegre.To avoid queues (common on the spot), call ahead to make a reservation.Upon arrival we were very well attended and for dinner we ordered a plate of shrimp and rice accompanied by a good sparkling wine.The decoration of the place is very beautiful, modern and refined.Very good for a romantic dinner!I recommend!\n",
      "Friendly service. The portion of french fries with pepperoni is a perfect and gigantic delicacy !!!The pizza breaks a branch as a snack. I missed an air-conditioned environment, because Rio was melting at the time. Want to eat well, and pay the right price? The place is here. I recommend.\n",
      "Like Rubaik, one of the owners is one of the former employees of the famous Rubaik, and the place as well as the food were of the same excellent standard. It's worth it, but it could be a little more affordable, like the Expetus Restaurant in Alagoas, great in everything, even lobster rodizio and the best cost-benefit.\n",
      "From 6pm there is a carvery of pizza and crepe at Frontera de Copacabana. Outside the food is very good and the soda refill the decoration of the place is too much. I was delighted !!\n",
      "I went to the buzz to see him nominated in the Magazine Comer e Beber. The atmosphere is really excellent, very relaxed, the sound the day I went was rock and it was great. Very cold beer and special to the pastel that is the best of Recife. It is located in Recife Antigo, and its houses, from the time of the Dutch, make the environment a very alternative and pleasant retro place.\n",
      "A nice place to have lunch .... Good food, good price and beautiful people. The only problem is that it is SOOOO hot, really ... The waiter was literally dripping, which is not cool. The service is very slow. I would come back just for the environment of beautiful people.\n",
      "Despite the very simple decor, the place is incredible, a 180 degree view of the blue sea of ​​Fortaleza. Very tasty food, very fair price. I go and come back whenever possible.\n",
      "I really liked the bar, with electronic music in a place that only has country music. Great option to give a variety and see beautiful people. The entrance costs 15 reais. Drinks are expensive inside.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant and service. Very cozy, family atmosphere.The food is divine !!! A great choice of restaurants with all the best. Super polite waiters.I'll be back more often!\n",
      "A great option for those looking for good, cheap and quality food. I love the Bahian food it offers.\n",
      "The atmosphere is pleasant.It has a children's area.I went on the carvery and found that the snacks took too long between one service and another.All the hamburgers were a bit alike: bread, hamburger and some details like a pickle, an egg, bacon, etc.It seems that there were two savory pizzas (baiana and pepperoni) and two sweets, chicken in the bird, french fries (with cheddar and bacon), small churros (without filling).I asked for the bill and I believe it took about 30 min.\n",
      "With a stripped decoration and cozy lighting, Bartô Hamburgueria already appeals at first sight, as it works in a kind of front garden. Service is another differential. A friendly and efficient group leaves you free to choose between sandwiches and portions made with care and with first-rate ingredients. Finally, there are quality beers for different tastes. I recommend the Viking sandwich (wonderful) and, if you like beer, pair it with a Hop Lager or a Vienna, from the Louvada Brewery. That experience is worth it. Even more with the cost benefit which is very good.\n",
      "I went to the restaurant for a Saturday lunch with German feijoada. About the environment I found it excellent, well refreshed, spacious, very clean, well located and with free parking. Excellent service, helpful and polite waiters. As for the buffet I found it very good, with good options of starters with fine cheeses, good options of salads and many hot dishes. That day the menu was cooked lamb, duck, pork ribs, sausages and sausages, sauerkraut, apple puree and others, in addition to the German feijoada that in my taste did not add anything. The most traditional dishes, like Eisbein and Strudel are a la cart, so I will have to return to complete the experience. Of the draft beer options, what deserves a highlight is a dark produced in the region, very light and refreshing.\n",
      "The food is delicious, the establishment is a barbecue house! The difference is the attractive price on the east side of the city. Accessible dishes compared to other places. What sins is the service that is not always agile, I've had problems twice but in general it is reasonable.\n",
      "Located at Bahia Marina, but with no sea view. The atmosphere is very pleasant. The food is good, the menu quite expensive. The dish came wrong, as well as the point of the meat, the waiter arranged for the exchange immediately.\n",
      "Super nice place, always has live music. The snacks are very delicious and the meals for lunch are very well served. In addition to the location, close to everything.\n",

      "The rib with the Boi Vindo barbecue sauce is one of the best in town.Good portion of meat, accompanied by french fries.The staff are polite and the atmosphere is very familiar, with live music for several days a week.\n",
      "It took almost an hour and a half to deliver, and the pizza came completely cold and rubbery. They said they wrote down the wrong address. However, they could at least have made another pizza, instead of sending one ready for more than 1 hour.I hope it was a one-off mistake, but I don't ask for it anyways.\n",
      "Very diverse bakery. Great, good location. Regional breakfast. The Bakery has an unusual concept in the city, I mean, it is a vanguard. Unfortunately the price of the products is above the usual in the city.\n",
      "clean restaurant. I was very well attended good food !!!! I went to business I intend to return with the family\n",
      "The restaurant has already had its simplest phase and three years ago it underwent a major renovation. Nothing more than a self service restaurant and some A la carte dishes. Of course, it has a fantastic Yaksoba, but the service was never the strong point of the house.\n",

      "Totally picturesque place with tables on the street and lots of people passing by. The scooter is sensational, the best part is the broth served separately. The service is good and the beer is always very cold. It is worth knowing this traditional point of our Bahia.\n",
      "I highly recommend, wonderful service and food, very cozy place. What is not so cool is the waiting time, but it was certainly worth it.\n",
      "Good place with several snack options, sandwiches, it takes a little time to attend, the price is fair, the normal price for salty snacks in the city, several different and very tasty sandwiches, worth checking out.\n",

      "If you are looking for a place in Salvador that will provide you with a great gastronomic experience for two, the answer should be Amado. Book an outside table, order a wine and relax, waiting for the food that will be carefully prepared for you. The place is impeccable but I think the wine list can still improve.\n",
      "I was with my wife on 07/14/16 in this restaurant, thinking about the wonders announced in advertisements. The discomfort started in the parking lot, they did not want to let me park, although they charge R $ 10.00, I am still obliged to endure a stranger entering my car and maneuvering. We ordered strip roast, the thin polenta and the traditional salad, with tomato, heart of palm and lettuce, which cost an incredible R $ 35.00. The discomfort continued when, they brought the strip roast before the polenta and the salad. The waiter did not accept my request to suspend the salad and the polenta and took the meat back, and I told him that I would not eat reheated meat, he replied that it would not be the same (later I saw that it was the same, even because there was only another couple at the restaurant and eating pizza, which seemed grotesque to me). They brought the wrong polenta, instead of the fine one they brought another one in small squares and thick, stupidly greasy. All of us having to listen to waiters' wheels talking in a loud voice about problems in their private lives, with no idea of ​​their inconvenience and showing a total lack of professionalism. The manager, wearing a white shirt out of his pants, passed by all the time without realizing anything, even because that must be the normal restaurant. But the worst was yet to come. We were unable to eat the roast, it was hard as stone, all four cuts. I don't know how a restaurant is not ashamed to serve meat like that, nor would a dog be so tough. I will never go back to this place, I know that this is not a day when things went wrong, it is incompetence that comes from the owners, everything is rough, the service is terrible, it is noted that there is no training, it is labor exploited, cheap and without quality. I do not blame the waiters, but the administrators, who are experts but are unprepared people, except to offer a service and food that they think to deceive someone. Escape from this place, or go there and then report here what happened.\n",
      "The place is very beautiful and the service was excellent.The food is wonderful and very well served. There is no way not to be satisfied.The crab shell for starter was the best I've ever eaten.Worth the price you pay.If the intention is to eat good food, I highly recommend it.\n",
      "In the vicinity of Lagoa da Pampulha. I found it a little difficult to locate him. It is in a bucolic location, has horses for rent and a place for children. The food is of good quality.\n",
      "I had a great pizza at this place. Very large slice, you can choose option with borders. Many varieties of juices and vitamins too.\n",
      "Very top restaurant, excellent service, food with a magnificent flavor! Best Indian Restaurant in Belo Horizonte.\n",
      "The rustic atmosphere and typical foods of the northeast, from the regional coffee to Buchada de Bode.Menu rich. I was very satisfied, the employees all from Lampião and Maria Bonita, really good,\n",
      "Service leaves something to be desired, many employees, but little agility, complained when we ordered mate with little lemon ...\n",
      "Let's eat well then: Among the 25 cuts, the breast, the termite and the lath rib are the most requested. About forty items compete for space at the buffet, among cheeses, salads, sushi and hot dishes, such as the artichoke risotto. Lunch costs R $ 34.90 from Monday to Thursday, R $ 39.90 on Fridays and R $ 54.90 on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. At dinner, the customer pays R $ 34.90 on any day. The winery stores wines such as the Argentine Catena Zapata Malbec (R $ 92.90). At the end, the petit gâteau (R $ 18.90) comes on the scene. Ponteio was located on the edge of Boa Viagem Beach in Recife, air conditioning was not used because the breeze was part of this special house, which is now two blocks farther from Praia, requires 100% air conditioning. And the most delicious that few know is to ask for the traditional Argentine steak or BIFE DE CHORIZO (ARGENTINO) GRILLED WITH GREEN LEAVES now the green leaves have not reached. rsrsrsrsrsr\n",
      "It is a new restaurant that offers an excellent menu of imported sake. The sushi and sashimi are also fresh and well selected.\n",
      "Lots of variety with unmatched quality in all items. Good music, family atmosphere, easy access, shuttle service, good value for money. The strong and the meat, good barbecue, is worth it.\n",
      "Of the starters that were ordered, only the crab cone was worth it. Breaded shrimp and codfish cake are not enough. Moqueca and bobó are just good. The price is high for the quality.\n",
      "First-rate reception. Large and air-conditioned place. Stay upstairs with a view of the bald hill. First world service. We ordered the international prawns with five star quality.\n",
      "In Beira Mar, cold and cheap beer, crunchy and cheap crab legs. Good choice for an end of day.\n",
      "Coco bamboo offers a wide variety of dishes. All delicious and very goodServed. Specialty and shrimp, but the place has meat, fish, lobster, chicken too. The flagship is the international camarao, which serves 4 people. Dishes well served and with large shrimps and with a lot of quantity. I love having lunch at this place. Both Curitiba and other locations in other cities. Service and food are well standardized. InCuritiba, the restaurant is inside the crystal shopping mall. The starters, juices and desserts are delicious too. Very pleasant environment, wonderful service. Good to go with friends, family, business.\n",
      "It was a nice dinner ... however, it bothered the people who stayed outside asking for alms .... good food\n",
      "Great atmosphere, very efficient and helpful service (don't be shy to ask for explanations about the dishes - they do it with great patience and objectivity). The chef is always around, birding at the tables and talking with sympathy with everyone. Although sophisticated, the atmosphere is informal due to the service of all. The main one, the food, I can say that it was one of the most sophisticated and well elaborated of all the restaurants I have frequented around the world. The menu of French foods is very diverse and I can suggest what we tried: the confit de foie gras was unforgettable, the quail ordered by my wife (boneless and tender) was spectacular. This is not a popular restaurant, so the price lives up to what is proposed. Individual dishes around 75-90 reais. Wine list with many French labels in addition to good Argentines and Chileans with a price range of 600-100. Book now at around 9:30 pm it is difficult to get a seat. Very recommended for a special dinner in Porto Alegre\n",
      "Differentiated gastronomy, super pleasant atmosphere, excellent service, excellent space For children, expensive parking\n",
      "Bistrô & Boteco surprised me. The dishes are delicious. The waiters are super attentive and are always around us, asking if everything is perfect. And the price is very reasonable, considering that it works in one of the best shopping malls in the city. It is recommended the shrimp in the cream of strawberry and Greek rice It's all good!\n",
      "Excellent service. Super helpful staff, very good food. The bar owner is always accessible to everyone. Highly recommend\n",
      "Bar do Beto is traditional in Cidade Baixa and is always worth a visit. The food is very tasty and the portions are quite generous - serving up to 3 people. Everything was very well prepared, top-notch service, and even with a full house we were served in about 20 minutes. Great for going with friends.\n"

It just doesn't get 5 stars because I still don't think it's reasonable to have 5 hours to wait to be served ( between putting a name on the list and actually sitting at a table). As I really wanted to meet, I waited and was prepared for the delay (I drank at the neighbor who had a nice Jazz and even went to Vila Mariana to visit kkk relatives)\n",

The pepper sauce comes with green black peppers which gives it a different taste although it is a little spicy. If you are looking to eat for little, this is certainly not the place.\n",
      "I placed my order for delivery and I was in love with this restaurant ‘affectionate messages in my packaging I loved the way they treat food. Thank you spoleto my meal was excellent 👍🏼 ❤️\n",
      "Traditional, attentive, polite service.Very good and abundant food, very pleasant atmosphereWorth the visit\n",
      "In my opinion, the pizzeria 68's forte is pasta and not pizzas. I find it very pleasant to go with two or a few friends and a more intimate atmosphere. On Saturday afternoons, I recommend sitting on the sidewalk outside.\n",
      "Excellent service and Coco Bamboo shrimp dish, in addition to the frozen caipirinha! Always recommend!\n",
      "I was with the family on Sunday for lunch and I really liked it, family atmosphere, live music with a great singer and a very good MPB repertoire.The food was good, but the baião of two left something to be desired had more beans than meat, the ribs on the barbecue were great.Good service from the waiters.\n",

      "Everything in this bakery is delicious, of course it's not that cheap.However, anyone who wants quality cleaning can't let it go!As for the service, we have to be patient, and well attended!But nothing is another world .... KkkkkIt is worth waiting a little while.Parking is perfect.Just check it out!\n",
      "We were at the restaurant during Restaurant Week 2014. On the day of our visit, another event was taking place at the restaurant, so the service ended up BEEEEEm slow and one of the entries was not available.In compensation the food was just wonderful! The main dish, garlic steak with rice and green beans is well served and very delicious. It's worth asking!\n",
      "The place has little space and the atmosphere gives a negative impression, but when you sit down and place your order you will not regret it, very good food, well served, excellent, first class service, the baked fish is delicious, not to mention price that is fair,\n",
      "Simple restaurant with regional food. The flagship is the rubacao, which is very good. The price is steep, but it is worth knowing. It is in front of the drivers' square in Jaguaribe. Next to the state court of accounts. A good option for those in the region to have lunch.\n",
      "The atmosphere is very pleasant, it has several tables for groups and tables in a space like a winter garden too. Very attentive service and very friendly waiters. Despite having ordered the simplest meat of all, I have never had such a tasty chicken breast in my life! Everyone at the table praised the meat. The accompaniment rotation is also very good, I just thought I could have more different options. Note a thousand p / the spinach cream. A small note that serves as a suggestion for the restaurant: if the cover charge is per person, it should be written on the menu. The hostess did not inform us at the entrance and we only found out when the bill came. But that didn't erase the great impression of the service and the food we had. The price is right for the quality and quantity. I didn't eat the famous petit gateau, but the apple pie was delicious. When I return (and I will certainly return) I will be sure to try Jacquin's petit gateau.\n"

      "I arrived at the airport early in an attempt to anticipate my flight. Sweet illusion (holiday month). I decided to go out and walk around. Unlike SP, Santos Dumont airport is very close to a MAM museum and this restaurant (on the museum's premises). It is worth the 5 minute walk, in addition to the view of the bay, the restaurant is worth it. Upon arriving the chef offers a surprise, on the day it was a seafood stew (delicious) and then I went straight to the plate. I ordered an octopus with quinoa risotto of black and pepperoni with harissa (hot pepper sauce common in North African cuisine - Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria). The octopus was perfect, soft, tasty with a little crunch (the minimum obligation of a restaurant that purports to be what it is). What surprises are the side dishes. The octopus alone was almost without salt, but when eating with the risotto they complemented each other so that one would not survive without the other. Perfect combination. I had a glass of Rose Las Moras (possible) and tried the suggestion of the sommelier, a Swiss wine from the gameret grape (mixture of gamay with pinot), a combination that is also possible.Service: friendly and attentiveSommelier: interested and educatedPleasant environmentCuriosity: there is a fee of R $ 1.00 for being alone (?)If you have two hours of flight waiting, it is worth the walk, since the airport self service restaurant (14bis) has a value of 99 reais per kilo and cannot be compared.\n",
      "Fast service, tasty food and fair prices. Nice atmosphere, we waited a few minutes in line, despite the restaurant being crowded. Highlight for the pita bread and fried kibe that were delicious.\n",
      "Go to Açai Aju and be sure to eat the various pastries and açai from this place. It is simply delicious and worth the extra calories you gain from eating.\n",
      "Great cost benefit. The dishes are the usual and with attractive prices. As I am a fan of their sandwiches, whenever I can eat there. Highlight for the sanduba with chicken teryaki.\n",
      "The liver with jiló is amazing! I didn't like them both and tried it. Liked it!!!!The cangiquinha is also delicious. It's worth the visit!\n",
      "Every time I went, I felt the same. Place to go and feel at home. Good music, excellent weather, good service, cold drink, in short the ideal combination to enjoy the night. Highly recommend !!!\n",
      "The service is to be desired !!It takes too long to get the order! The drinks are missing the menu !!Anyway, you need a lot much better, and be for the cause, Increase these values ​​!!!\n",
      "Sushi is always good. This is also the case, but the restaurant has many irregularities and serves poorly.The waiter chose who would answer and the women at the table were ignored completely. The gracom only spoke to men. too ridiculous\n",
      "Pleasant decor, attentive staff, fresh meat, wonderful draft beer and a must-have dulce de leche mousse! I recommend. The only point is that house prices in São Paulo far exceed those of Curitiba's burger.\n",
      "if it is for lunch, do not go after 13hrs, because the replacement is not ideal, be prepared to maybe wait, good food and good price, I recommend.\n",
      "We don't like the Yemanjá restaurant. Neither the physical space nor the food. I don't think we arrived on a very favorable night.\n",

      "I was at the stalos to buy a piece of pizza and a broth to go, as I was at the next hotel (Savoy), I went there. In addition to the poor service, the girls pretending they were not seeing me and ignoring my note of the request. When I arrived my broth was with two fingers of oil on top, cold, the pizza was also cold. I tried to take the oil out of the broth so I wouldn't have to go back, but it was impossible to take. Horrible.\n",
      "the famous submarine, it’s a delight, you end up wanting to drink several to collect the caniquinho that comes inside\n",
      "The price is very nice, the food is very tasty, the dishes are well prepared. Excelent reception.\n",
      "Just don't come to the mall just to come here. Sunday family lunch. Children, full house, slower service, complete package. The food, which is of interest, is no big deal. In Brasilia, I still prefer the city's classic and competitor: El Paso Texas.\n",
      "I've been going to the restaurant for almost 20 years and the quality remains. The souffles have decreased in size, but are still excellent, I suggest smoked surubim or gruryere. For the main course I recommend the shrimp in Provencal or duck carre, I have eaten fois gras a long time ago and it was excellent. Dessert cannot be anything other than profiteroles. You know something really cool? My husband and I like to order two dishes and share each dish, at Taste Vin, if you tell us you are going to share them, they already have tidies in two dishes, this is a differential !!! It is an expensive restaurant, and you have to book a weekend.\n",
      "We were attracted by the promise of good hamburgers and absurdly cold beer and the house does its job well!\n",

      "I have frequented the big boat for years, but always when I go it is the same feeling as the first time, paying attention to your surroundings you always notice a new decoration, something that draws attention.Throughout the bars and shops always great service, always good food, pleasant atmosphere, always surprising.I recommend a Sunday with friends or family.\n",
      "Really expect more after reading so many comments. The decor could be more neat. Well-served dishes and reasonable price\n",
      "Cozy restaurant, but not very tasty food. Every week the same dishes. There is neither variety nor friendliness of the attendants. It's worth it for a quick lunch. Very tasty chocolate pave.\n",
      "The atmosphere is a cool lamberjack style and sometimes has a live band. At night it has a bar atmosphere.Capo burguer is wonderful!\n",

      "Worth knowing. Cozy. Fast service. They pick up and take them to the hotel. Great food. The location is also very satisfactory, allowing you to visit other places in the surroundings such as handicrafts.\n",
      "The Pinga Fogo Restaurant has two types of buffets, the buffet of conventional foods, and the sushi buffet, which for me is magnificent, I am suspicious to speak, because I love sushi. It has a great location, but I just don't like the lack of parking, you have to look on the street, if you are lucky you will find a place near the restaurant.\n",
      "The steakhouse has very basic food, without many options. The atmosphere is nice and the waiters are very helpful. At the top of the steakhouse is pizza rodizio. The carvery pizza is excellent. Several options and great quality. Worth checking out\n",
      "Very well attended by Souza ... Pleasant atmosphere and to relax a background sound ... Without a doubt a good place to have lunch or dinner in Fortaleza ... Congratulations!\n",
      "The food is very good, tasty and is out of the ordinary on the menu of Arab cuisine. The problem with the location is space. There are several environments, the 1st is a small one, decorated in the Arabian style, puffs, rugs, half light to give a more intimate look. There, in addition to the dance show, there is a musical performance. There is a second place, with some Arab decoration, but there is a lack of attention to details. The 3rd is on the outside, a tent, canvas walls, with some arabesques. Plastic chairs and tables, there is also a sample of the dances that take place in the 1st hall. In the 1st hall, in addition to belly dancing, there is folk dance. In the 3rd, only a few short numbers of belly dancing, without folk dance and much less with the musical presentation, the sound is transmitted by speakers. The place is not cozy. The service is buffet, the space in which it is served looks like a large garage, it intends to be an elegant place, but for that there is a lot of investment. What saves is good food, but the sweets ... could be more Arab.\n"

The staff are very polite, especially Gabriel and Jonathan who attended us were very attentive and the atmosphere is beautiful and super nice! We ate the dish that was a sea bass with shrimp risotto and ended with the cocada with tapioca ice cream, both incredible! It is worth knowing when staying in Maceió.\n",
      "say what you want! you can even give yourself the right to dislike the location and even the frequency but ....the always discreet and cordial service of very well presented waiters and waitresses, the food, then, is wonderful (from bread to olive oil, from starter to main course, from dessert to coffee!parade very well-assembled dishes of unparalleled Asian flavorgo and check(don't expect to pay little because they know how to charge, but it's worth every penny)a tip: from Monday to Friday they have an executive lunch from the entrance to dessert with a lower price (without taking anything away from the beauty and flavor of the dishes)\n",
      "I learned that the general population of Aracaju DOES NOT GO TO Aracaju BEACHES and for two reasons. The main one is the abusive price of the things sold by the stalls and the other reason is the terrible service is the lack of willingness of the stall staff. This one in particular is the worst tent on the coast in terms of service. Stay in it for a short time because I could not stand the lack of respect with my family. When asking for a second umbrella the waiter simply ignored it and stayed on his cell phone looking at messages. On this day the tent was only with 3 people. Avoid this tent if you don't want to be bored. The tourist is the one who keeps the tents alive and they don't give a damn about it. Lack of administration and lack of service.\n",
      "The pizza is good and with some variety but it is not something out of this world. Very pleasant environment but the price is a bit salty.\n",
      "One of the most famous bars in Aracaju, located on the Caranguejo catwalk, Amanda is in fact one of the mandatory stops in the city !!!Good food, good service and with big crabs !!!It is worth that stop !!!!\n",
      "Incredible atmosphere, tasty food. They need to improve the accuracy at the point of the meat. I asked to the point but it came well past. But otherwise, the food was good. Only the price is a bit steep, but it is a restaurant for special occasions.\n",
      "Several food options, and some of Minas Gerais cuisine. I found the price a little high for the quality offered\n",
      "Imagine a magical call, typically carioca. Sun, sea, green with everything a bohemian is entitled to. No ostentation, a cold beer with a delicious pastry by the sea, sitting on a short wall. That's what makes a carioca happy, or if you prefer about the restaurant that has the best seafood menu (in my humble opinion), from Rio and Janeiro. If you haven’t experienced that feeling, go for it. You will fall in love.\n",

      "What to say ... Summing up the operation ... Excellent service, a great buffet, good variety of meats ..Well ... Price ... I paid 120 $$ me and my wife with drinks and one on the table .. Do you think it's expensive? Come visit the river and you will see that this price does not pay even a person with this structure ..Note: the meat is much better than friboi ...\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, good service, excellent food, varied menu ranging from crepe, tapioca to more elaborate food. A good choice are the pizza (the shrimp is a delight, then) and honestly I don't know any other like it ... Still on the pizzas when you try the coconut bamboo you will really know what a real pizza is. Meals are also good. The desserts, oh those are not mentioned are mouthwatering, delicious! There are toys for those who take the children. It's super worth checking out.\n",

      "In this restaurant I went with the expectations high, and for the incredible that it seems they were surpassed. I left a course so I went at a “lunchtime” time (around 4pm) so I didn't face lines. I arrived with my husband and already had a table for two.We ordered the tasting menu, and for those who eat “little” (like me) it gets to be a lot of food, with so many options.I don't even know how to express taste and quality. It's really worth it.\n",

      "I went to dinner at Cocobambu at Shopping Recife, wishing for the wonderful sun meat crepe, but when I asked the waiter he said there was no pizza in that cocobambu. I'm from Fortaleza and I love this restaurant. The food is always very good, the service ... in fact there was even live music very good. Too bad I couldn't eat my crepe and my salad came in a normal dish (in Fortaleza it comes in a delicious pizza crust). But it is very good !!!\n",
      "In addition to the traditional dish at this establishment, when I ordered a garlic and oil spaguetti, to my surprise, it came very well done, with plenty of garlic and oil (olive oil), I asked to accompany some slices of meat. I recommend.\n",
      "First of all, chef Lui deserves congratulations for his competence and friendliness. However, the amounts charged are excessively high (120 reais for a shrimp risotto!) And there is no transparency in the collection. Upon receiving the bill in the approximate amount of 780 reais, we were already paying when we noticed that the value of the service was over 100 reais, therefore well above 10% of the total consumed. I called the manager to ask, thinking it was a mistake. He explains that THE RESTAURANT CHARGES 15% (!) OF SERVICE FEE. It happens that in NO PLACE IN THE ACCOUNT THE PERCENTAGE IS SHOWN, MAKING BELIEVE THAT THE INTENT IS REALLY GOING UNMISSED. In good Portuguese, the famous SE COLAR, COLOU. Trying to explain himself, he still claims that most restaurants, including all restaurants located in Pontão, charge a 15% service fee. I usually go to restaurants of all kinds and I know that statement is not true, making me conclude as a false and dishonest argument. A pity, because it puts everything else to waste. I suggest that everyone who receives such a charge, stop paying the entire service fee, because only then will they change their attitude.\n",
      "It is a very nice and cozy bar / restaurant / art gallery. Very good to meet friends to chat, drink and eat.\n",
      "Good food good churasco, the house also serves Japanese food, but the `` gentleman who welcomes us Mr Hugo`` was not honest in the description of values, as my wife does not eat barbecue and I was told a price per kilo in Japanese food, however at the time of regret it was another, he came with lame excuses and became unfriendly, so be an expert !!!\n",
      "wide variety of pastries, well filled and with honest price! and the same as the municipal market, it is worth knowing\n",
      "I went to taste the açaí Lenom, wonderful, simply one of the best açaí I have ever tasted, accompanied by paçoca, what a delight.\n",
      "Very good food and compatible price. Unparalleled mayonnaise salad. Good service, easy parking and fair price. Varied menu.\n",
      "It must be the oldest restaurant in Recife. The service was very good. He, being old, has a lot of prestige among the society of Recife. It's not popular, quite classic. On the day we ate seafood and it was a little bit longer than the time on the fire. But presentation of the dish and everything else excellent.\n",
      "I went to Ilha do Caranguejo after numerous recommendations. The intention was to prove the famous crab, however, it was closed season and the restaurant was prohibited from selling. I opted for the famous capixaba moqueca for two, fish with shrimp and I loved it! The dish is very well served and can serve 3 to 4 people. The pastries are also very good! Cold beer and great service. Super recommend!\n"

      "I like the collar. It has an infinite list of beers and several delicious snacks. I think the idea of ​​individual portions is great, and my favorite is the baroa potato dumpling stuffed with gorgonzola. I already went for lunch and I liked it too. It's that traditional carioca scheme, like filet Oswaldo Aranha, for example. It has happened that the kitchen is not so fine-tuned and some snacks arrive at the table well soaked, but it was punctual. The service doesn't move or bother you, but it may happen that a waiter will eventually be more moody. Anyway, I think it's worth it.\n",

      "I even understand that the service leaves a little to be desired in a newly opened restaurant, but Le Bife disappointed me at that point. A waiter looked like a landscape when asked about the point of the meat. Another dropped a piece of zucchini on my arm. The dishes were not served correctly (they changed the sauces). The potato was served with the salad when we asked to come with the main course. They forgot to make the change to our reservation and had to squeeze eleven people at four tables.The meat was good, but the side dishes were very trivial (rice, flour, cooked vegetables, potato gratin and puree).

      "Excellent pasta and risottos, the meats are wonderful (grilled to order). The metri Luis Antônio (Zé Colméia) was very polite and cordial, and was always concerned with our well being. I highly recommend it! We love the sparkling wine that was recommended by metri. Congratulations!\n",

      "The menu is lean and the snacks are very tasty, they always hit the spot. Good beer options, although the prices are not exactly friendly. Get there early, the chance of waiting is high, the number of tables is very small. The Original burger is top, some may consider the size of the snack small - I consider them the ideal size! They should put the option with gorgonzola sauce and watercress back on the menu - the best !!!!\n",
      "Disappointing, he went to lunch with my family on Sunday around 14: 00hs. As my wife and daughters do not eat much, I asked for a mini skewer, and then we prepared to eat, but there was no meat, I asked the waiter, but nothing helped, we started eating salad, because it was the only thing on the table, the polenta was cold and greasy. Beside me the table was full of skewers and the meat came straight.I ask:Mini skewer has no meat?Then I spoke again as a waiter who in turn said that the meat was being roasted and would soon come.I can't understand, because the only difference between the mini skewer and the complete skewer is that one comes with picanha and the other does not.So why was meat on the next table and not for me?Frustrating....\n",
      "Normal food, normal atmosphere. Only if you are passing by, but a common restaurant. Regular.\n",
      "Honestly I have never seen such a competent wait staff, the staff is to be congratulated !!! I live in a city of 400 thousand inhabitants and we go to various places to eat and I have never seen people so synchronized, the food is good and the carvery was wonderful, congratulations to all\n",

      "We stayed at the celi hotel, on the edge of Atalaia, which is very close to the Pitu com Pirão restaurant. We went to dinner at this restaurant and were very well attended by waiters Jeferson and Buiu. We ordered a grilled sea bass with vegetables, rice and pitu pirão. It was wonderful. Not to mention great quality wines and cold beer. In addition, the owner of the house (Pedro) brought us an explored olive oil for us to try and season the food. Dear very good people. The price is right for the excellent level of the food offered. So we ended up returning the next day to have lunch at Pitu with Pirão. It's really worth it. Be sure to go to this restaurant when you go to Aracaju. It's top.\n",
      "I really enjoyed the restaurant. It is in the style of eat for a relatively cheap value (around 36 reais). The food is typical Goiana, the sweets are delicious. In a rustic style, it is spacious and very worthwhile.\n",

      "Very nice place to go with the class or family to taste snacks and have a good draft beer. It also serves stronger dishes, some of which serve two people.The only problem is parking, especially at night, as it usually does not offer more space and you are obliged to leave your vehicle in an unsafe place.\n",
      "Good food, good service, elegant atmosphere, sophisticated decor.I opted for a Pancia di maiale, pork belly with crispy skin, which accompanies gnocchi alla sorrentin. Tasty but I found the gnocchi sauce acidic. For dessert, a creme brulee with pistachio ice cream that was incredible but I found it expensive for the size (more than 30 reais).\n",

      "I have been going to Café Árabe for over 4 years and the restaurant always offers very tasty food, fast and kind service, as well as the honest price.

I did two more tests to not be unfair.In the last orders the packaging was stuck to the pizza. Very oily, thick and cold pizza.In the last lost, the coca cola was stuffed and expired.I made a complaint over the phone and got no excuse.Never!\n",

      "I have been to Amado several times. The environment is beautiful, and has the best view of the sea in Bahia. The food is excellent, everything I have tasted so far was wonderful.It is a little expensive, but it is worth knowing.\n",
      "A restaurant with an excellent location, facing the sea of ​​Cabo Branco, with an air-conditioned external environment (which I couldn't stay because it was already busy), pleasant internal environment, ambient music, qualified service ranging from receptionists to waiters. In the parking lot they welcome you with a umbrella until the door of the establishment. Menu with very varied dishes, normal prices for sophisticated cuisine. Interesting wine list, but few cheaper wine options, so on a hot day the option was to savor Corona Mexican beer, at a regular price. We ordered grilled octopus as a snack, wonderful, perfect texture. The main dish we chose was the Spanish shrimp (I think that was the name). Despite being an individual dish, the restaurant divided it in two for us (we had already consumed the snack and 5 beers). This shrimp promised to be in gorgonzola sauce, and that's when there was sin. With no traces of gorgonzola, we savored the dish accompanied by rice that promised to be Sicilian (with a lemon that passed away too!) And mashed potatoes. Anyway, we realized that this dish was not what it promised, the emotion was lacking. Even so, it does not affect the excellence of the service, the quality of the restaurant and certainly the octopus paid off and other dishes can also be tastier.\n",

The sound of the exciting piano accompanying a delicious first-tier watered with great sparkling wine at a very fair price. At Casa de Tereza I always want to return to Salvador.\n",
      "For me the best steakhouse in Cuiabá. A wide variety of meats. Its forte is the hopefully run, but it has a huge variety of salads and a very varied buffet. Delicious desserts. A little expensive, but it's worth checking out.\n",
      "For you who like hamburger to the point of rare, I strongly recommend that you go to Z Deli, because there is a sensational spot in their house. Very tender and tasty meat. Note 10 :) We ordered the lamb burger and the black burger and we have no regrets. There was also the potato and some chopps. Everything was very good and arrived quickly. Just be careful with the capacity, if you want to enjoy it, arrive early to guarantee a place, otherwise just standing outside (I don’t like it much, but it’s the way if it’s full ahah)\n",
      "For the price and greatness of the ingredients I found the median burger to be good. The potatoes could be crispy. It is worth the experience because it is a French burger, original. Beautiful list of beers\n",
      "I took my girlfriend and we both approved of Sushi! There is no option of carvery and the price is a little high but it is very tasty!\n",

      "Inconvenient waiter. All the time wanting to know if we were going to have only draft beer or if we were going to place a bigger order. The initial intention was to have lunch at the restaurant but due to the lack of professionalism of the waiter we got up and left.\n",
      "I love the salad buffet for being very complete, it makes all the difference for lovers of healthy dishes who don't want to eat just pizza. The pizzas are very varied and have some very exotic. Best pizza in Poa.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant option for lunch in Palmas. It is located in a very wooded area and very close to Capim Dourado Shopping. The customer can choose to serve himself by weight or pay for the buffet and serve himself at will. I found the food to be very diverse, tasty and with lots of salad and meat options. Excellent cost benefit.\n",
      "The acarajé da Cira, among the famous of Salvador, is the best. This does not mean that it is the best in Salvador. There are many other neighborhood boards, with exceptional quality and much cheaper. But for those who want to spend an afternoon, having a beer and tasting a good acarajé, I recommend it. The service is to be desired. The attendants are not at all friendly.\n"

      "I was at the pizzeria recently, I ordered the flavors I always ask for; arugula with parma and chicken with curd. When the pizza arrived I was disappointed because I was used to the quality and care of the pizzeria. The parma pizza did not arrive as usual, before I ordered and arrived at the table with plenty of parma, living up to the flavor, the last time I ordered, pieces of parma came and in addition they did not share the flavors equally, adding more pizza chicken. If it is to save parma, it would be more efficient to get it off the menu soon. The pizza was even aesthetically poor, not consistent with the amount of almost 70 reais that is charged, a value that I did not think was unfair for the quality, but that now does not match. As for chicken, they substituted smoked chicken (which was much tastier) with regular chicken. The pizza was not bad, but I was used to it much more beautiful and tasty. I will return with less expectations and with the hope that I went on a bad day. The service and the environment are still very good.\n",
      "Cozy place, great service, selected ingredients, high quality standards.Amazing experience. It is already my favorite in São Paulo!\n",
      "The food is fantastic, we were in 4 people and we exchanged dishes to try several options, all delicious. The place is very charming and the service is very attentive. But, like everything that is good and new, in SP, the wait is long. But relax in the outdoor area by taking something, it makes the wait worthwhile.\n",
      "The food is very good and variedThe service is also very goodThe great dessertThe price is very reasonableUsually lovais are very pleasant despite the noise being very loudThey owe wifi\n",
      "Fast service, great location (close to the Butantã metro), affordable prices, quality meals, but what good is all of this if, when you arrive for breakfast, the atmosphere is unbearably hot, windows closed and air conditioning in ornament wall? Another tip is to clean the outside area in advance, I witnessed customers with no place to sit and leaving while the outside area was still being cleaned at 07:00 hrs.\n",
      "The place, although small, is comfortable, the service is somewhat casual, several times we had to strive to be served. The dish I ate, chicken with cashews and pineapple, I thought it was good, nothing too much, no very different flavor, they forgot the rice that accompanied it, they brought it a little later. I asked for the brownie for dessert, don't be fooled by the photo in the reviews, mine came in two, without nuts, with a drop of syrup and a scoop of melted and half tasteless cream ice cream. No sign of the strawberries, ok, it may not be the season, but the presentation is half-full, not worth it. Anyway, a good place, but nothing big.\n",
      "We hadn't been to this place in many years, today passing through the city we decided to go and enjoy the wonderful view and enjoy lunch. It was a perfect choice, first by Jorge's close service, who presented us with a good wine and always Cortez ... Then for the good choice, both from the entrance ... A delicious shrimp and also crab cake, and the choice of moqueca girlfriend was perfect to combine with wine. It's super worth it !!!!\n",
      "Very tasty pizza.We ordered half cream-cheese with leeks and half tenderloin.The latter was full of garlic, which I like, but it was making it difficult to taste the other ingredients.The cream-cheese one was great!I don't know the name of the waiter who served us, but he was very impatient.\n",
      "Clean, organized, inviting place for a good meal. Buffet with good variety. Plates with pleasant seasoning. Price is fair. I recommend it for family lunches.\n",
      "I have been to this restaurant several times, but the last time I did not like some things. The food remains good, as in many other restaurants I frequent in Porto Alegre, but I found it unpleasant to only have French mineral water, and for a very salty price! We asked for a ticket and the waiter said he would bring another similar, but at the time of the check, what a surprise, it was twice the price !! surely this should have been said before! I found the cost - benefit unattractive compared to others in the same category !!\n",
      "This restaurant is well known for the quality of its food. The specialty is seafood. The shrimp stew is very good.\n",
      "We chose to visit Coco Bambu at a very busy time, and at this point the restaurant has already caught our attention, as they were extremely organized and accommodated us well ahead of schedule.The menu and prices follow the average of these types of restaurant, resulting in some 150-200 per couple.As for the dish we ordered, it was a shrimp in the coconut, which was slightly sweet, and its side dishes, which were chestnut rice and pumpkin puree, further emphasized the dish's sweetness, which in a way was not very pleasant if considering that we wanted a savory dish. This was the only detail that prevented the fifth star, and is also due to our lack of knowledge on the regional menu.Finally, the ambience is very large, although it does not look from the outside, and very beautiful. We recommend!\n",
      "Excellent service, the food is great, I just didn't try the sweet dishes, the price is very affordable, I hope to return soon.\n",

      "The atmosphere is not sophisticated, but it is well organized and the staff are attentive and helpful. The buffet service with a single charge is a good choice. There could be a greater diversity of pasta and meat, as the options are not very varied. There was only one type of red meat and two types of pasta. There is a good variety of desserts and they are tasty. The view, however, is the main attraction.\n",
      "Perfect for a happy hour with friends, cold beer, snacks and live music. Very busy and pleasant place.\n",

      "I've been to Irajá three times. At first, I was delighted. Great starters, wonderful bread, good service, a dish I don't remember which one, but good.In the second and third, disappointment. First, it was very expensive compared to the first time. I found the service staff a bit of a beast. I ordered a pasta with pomodoro sauce and it came with a sweet sauce, it looked like guava. It's okay if the chef wants to innovate, but make it clear on the menu. The next time, I ordered a very expensive noodle with prawns, and the prawns came raw, rubbery.Is expensive. I honestly think it's not worth the price. And, in my view, the place clearly did not manage to maintain the quality, which is something very common in Rio.\n",

Good seasoning but pay attention to put entertainment but whoever pays and the customer even in the promotion pamphlets each day of the week offers you a different one, because they charged me for 1 hour that I was in the place they charged me 12 reals of couver, and they say on the menu that NO CHARGE 10% but in the account they charge yes. I asked Manager Sidney and he, instead of solving it, objected to me, and said he would be OBLIGED TO PAY THE COUVER ..... so as not to cause confusion I paid something that by law is not mandatory and optional and mr. Sidney Crab Manager Ponta Negra not satisfied was thick and disrespectful, as manager and lousy manager. CAUTION CAUTION CHARGE BEYOND THE INFORMED.\n",
      "Great service with João and great food, pleasant atmosphere, good music, Great place to celebrate birthday.\n",
      "Spettus' food is amazing. A wonderful carvery, accompanied by a 10-note buffet.\n",
      "Reasonable food, I ordered an imported steak that was not good. Maybe other dishes are better, the sushi was reasonable.\n",
      "Delicious picanha, pork ribs in barbecue sauce is top top ... The price is standard steakhouse, salted ... But it is very worth it. Anyone who likes salad has a nice salad tray.\n",
      "I liked the dish and the atmosphere, but the service left something to be desired. The waiter brought everything changed. First the drinks, then I didn't know how to give information about the dishes and lastly I got the bill wrong.\n",
      "The sandwich is very good, tasty, warm, crispy bread. The burger is tasty, well seasoned! However the fries left much to be desired. Minimal portion and potatoes all deformed. The bottom potatoes were the size of a coin. The natural juice reported in the combo said natural, whole. It was a little bottle of Prats. I expected natural juice, from the fruit, made to order.It was my first time at Madero to celebrate Father's Day, but the product compared to the high value, left something to be desired. It was legal to meet!\n",
      "Dishes very well served fish of excellent quality and very cold beerI recommend it and I will always come back\n",
      "Lots of variety of snacks, cold beer and great service. All of this at a fair price. Be sure to try the crab drumstick, it is spectacular.\n"

      "I tried this spaghetti finished inside the shell of a Parmesan cheese in Ciudad de Mexico, many years ago (very good, by the way). And I knew that in SP there were restaurants that made the same dish, but I never had the initiative to visit them.Recently (Mar / 19), much because of digital marketing advertising, I decided to visit this restaurant and try this dish.The restaurant is small (70 seats). So, wait in line, depending on the day and time. Identify, when placing your order in the queue, that you have an elderly person (it was my case) and / or a child in the group. According to them, there is priority in these cases (I didn't notice).We had already seen the menu and made our choice while we waited. Soon, we sat down and made all the requests. But it is worth noting that there was a delay before an attendant (very kind) came to us to take the order. There was also a delay in receiving drinks and dishes.The finishing of the famous pasta in the parmesan peel is done on a counter, where you go to follow the process. I will not spoil the recipe, but the dough was very good.Considering the dishes ordered and the service as a whole, I believe that the cost-benefit ratio of this restaurant is high, compared to other Italian restaurants in the same region. It was an experience, it was valid, but I would evaluate very well if I would return.\n",
      "This restaurant is a great option for lunchtime meals. Family restaurant with fast, kind and attentive service. The staff is always the same and the treatment is very friendly. Varied meals that cater to all tastes. The portions are generous and the cost is good too. Good for breakfast before a busy routine and also for a late afternoon snack.\n",
      "This pub is very good, well located, it is in the center, it has a quality draft beer and you can eat a very tasty snack and the price is very good!\n",
      "With several stores in the city, it offers an incredible variety ofproducts. A real feast for the eyes and palates. Great service, creative packaging, diet line and several chocolate options. I recommend .\n",
      "There is the restaurant that serves very good fish and seafood and then there is the bar, which serves fresh beer, delicious snacks all in front of one of the best views in Rio de Janeiro. And I don't even remember that you are in a city of 10 million people!\n",
      "It offers great options of regional foods, the price is fair, it has a wide variety of dessert, which is charged self service too, the only thing I didn't like was the lemon juice, it had a powdered juice flavor.\n",
      "Wonderful lunch, perfect side dishes and dessert.Each week a better menu than the other!Not to mention the burgers which is the best I've ever eaten in my lifeThe choricoisinhas then hummmmmm and too muchSuper recommend very worth just knowing\n",
      "Good variety of Japanese, Chinese and a little Peruvian food (ceviches). Most of the dishes are already ready, so it doesn’t have that flavor of freshly prepared but in the concept proposed, Fast Japa Food is approved.\n",
      "The reutaurante offers in its menu several types of fish, and really all the dishes are great and have a good price\n",
      "Typical pizzeria in São Paulo, simple, simple menu, great waiters.The pizza is thin and very large, twelve pieces. The mozzarella is wonderful.Be sure to try the coffee with cream at the end.\n",
      "I was at the restaurant this week and the food is really delicious! The service on site is great, everyone is attentive!I indicate the shrimp and cheese skewer as a starter, as it is delicious!The cost of the dishes is normal, no exaggeration!I indicate the location a lot!\n",
      "One of the pioneers in the preparation of guaiamum. Among the many snacks and excellent seafood. The prawns on the pumpkin with spinach cream are SIMPLY A DELICIA served with a piece of grilled tilapia and almond rice. I recommend!\n",
      "papacapim has always been good, but after this renovation it was much more pleasant, quiet and beautiful. it stands out for its wonderful pizza but in general everything is good. it also has an outdoor area that has a playground for children and electronic games.\n",
      "It's very good, both the feijoada and the seafood are the highlights of this restaurant. The price is a bit salty but the service and the quality of the food make this restaurant a point for celebrations.\n",
      "I didn't want to leave Belém without trying the famous Tacacá. It has a very different flavor and is very well served. Despite being a trailer it has good service, is clean and has a fair price (R $ 13).\n",
      "differential service, excellent. wonderful food. I went with friends and my 2 year old daughter, and everyone played with her, exchanged the little plate 2 times so she could try a little bit of everything.I highly recommend it to family and friends, very very good food. and wonderful cost benefit.\n",
      "The bread is very tasty! In the afternoon there is always warm bread and severalTypes of sweet and savory. Whenever I can I go there to have a snack. There they also make sandwiches on the plate and very good too. The service is good and it is close to the hotel where I stay, the Athenas Apart Hotel.\n",
      "Delicious food, pleasant atmosphere, excellent service! I will come back whenever I come to Campo Grande for sure!\n",
      "The meat sfiha is excellent. It is a family business, apparently and it is quite frequented, however, there are few attendants for many customers.\n",
      "After several times that I had passed, I decided to stop at this restaurant. I had the displeasure of having the worst experience of all the places I have been to in Goiânia. The place had few waiters who were visibly busy not being able to handle the service. We ordered a fillet with catupiry and heart of palm and, almost an hour and a half later (1.5 hours !!!) the dish arrives. Only wrong! Instead of fillet came chicken ... the rice was hard and cold. But the main course was ok.Anyway, normal food, terrible service !! Clearly lack of management! There is no concern about service or quality!Even the waiter seemed uncomfortable with the situation!I do not recommend!\n",
      "A very pleasant evening with friends, in a cozy atmosphere, wonderful portions and caipirinha, the very attentive waiter (Bahia).\n",
      "Who likes a cool restaurant is in the right place ... very good to go with friends .... mara food\n",
      "This restaurant serves simple but very good food, the steaks are the best part of the menu, but watch out for the mustard that comes on the table, certainly the strongest I have tasted in my entire life! The service is fast and the atmosphere is simple but comfortable, a good option.\n",
      "Quality service, with very attentive waiters and manager with customers. The order didn't take long to arrive and the best acarajé I've ever eaten. The siriguela caipifruta is delicious .. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere, wide variety of salads, cereals and vegetables, some hot options, and delicious desserts. Only a few cards are needed with the food, explaining the composition of the sauces and identifying the less obvious delights. You can't keep asking the attendants, while a line is forming at the busiest times.\n",
      "Special and wonderful meats. The side dishes are also delicious. A good wine list, varied prices, but high. Excellent restaurant! Anyone who wants to eat soft, quality meat has to go to Cabana Del Primo.\n",
      "Presentation of the dishes exceeds expectations, service always very fast and efficient. Maître Júnior super attentive, concerned with whether the food was to our taste.\n",
      "It is not a fine restaurant, but for those in the city center it is the best choice. The food is very tasty!\n",
      "Small, cozy atmosphere and interesting decor. The traditional ceviche was the best I've ever eaten in Rio de Janeiro, and there were many.\n",
