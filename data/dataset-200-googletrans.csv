"Special and wonderful meats. The side dishes are also delicious. A good wine list, varied but high prices. Excellent restaurant! Anyone who wants to eat soft, quality meat has to go to Cabana Del Primo.",1,1
"The Lunch Menu always brings excellent dining options, the only bad thing is that it is Monday through Friday. On weekends only the normal menu.",1,1
Amazing experience! Wonderful tasting menu and original and fun presentation! Worth all the success! Felipe-carioca was super friendly and efficient,1,1
"Restaurante Yemanju00e1 is very traditional in Salvador. Faithful to Bahian cuisine, it has an entrance of small, very crunchy acaraju00e9s with a generous portion of vatapu00e1 and dried shrimp. The dishes are well served and the price is fair. The environment is very themed and cozy, in addition to impeccable service. As a dessert I suggest the cocada but order the white and burnt mixture. It&#39;s delicious. It&#39;s worth the experience !!!",1,1
"Yesterday my husband made a reservation to celebrate my birthday. At the first contact, they rudely warned that after 8:30 pm the tables are occupied on a first come, first served basis. They sent us to the first floor without even showing us the way. We sat down and ordered the menu 3 times. After about 20 minutes we received the same and while choosing the dishes I checked the information that they do not accept cards, only checks or cash. An absurdity in the middle of Ipanema and the XXI century. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to have at least R $ 500.00 in the bag, at night in Rio de Janeiro to pay for dinner. We got up and decided to leave for another restaurant. The valet returned the car, all dirty with cement, as they parked it at the Metro construction site. We left for Restaurante D&#39;Amici in Leme, where we were well served, where the grouper ravioli with prawns and saffron sauce was divine.",0,1
"For sure, the best restaurant in Maceiu00f3 !!!! Refined atmosphere, delicious food and an excellent wine list! Great for a good dinner for two and the prices are great !!!! It&#39;s really worth it! I recommend!!!!!",1,1
"Wonderful International Shrimp, the place always reminds me of good memories, good food, excellent service and great price. Perfect combination!",1,1
"We stayed in front of Praia and Barraca Landrua. Excellent location, good food, good service, cold beer. The dishes serve 3 people. Fair price, I really enjoyed it.",1,1
"Very pleasant place, refined and frequented by beautiful people! Wonderful souffles, which are the flagship of the house, but offer other culinary wonders. Huge and varied cellar, with over 5,000 wine titles! Wonderful!",1,1
"I was at Castro&#39;s Park Hotel that weekend and ordered room service. It was so surprising that I thought it was fair to write this review. Congratulations to the kitchen team for the quality of the dishes. I ordered a filet sandwich with catupiry which was very well served. However, the highlight was the dessert: Petit Gateau de Buriti. Very tasty, surprising and original! Finally, congratulations to the team that delivers to your room. The gentleman who attended us was extremely friendly. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t get his name, but he was working on the night of 22/09, so here are my thanks.",1,1
"Very good snack bar for those who just want a quick snack. Sandwiches with a wide variety of flavors. Very good natural juices. Price a little salty, but it is worth enjoying a good snack!",1,1
"I have been a customer for years at Velho Rabo and I say that the establishment is the best in the Pompu00e9ia neighborhood. For customers who like the bars in Vila Madalena, try the Old Rabo! He gives 10 to 0 at any bar there. The service is one of the strongest points of the bar / restaurant. Managers, employees and even the owner are very friendly, know how to welcome all types of customers and never forget an order. Honesty also adds a positive point, because if any dish is delayed they will tell you exactly why the delay (for example, because the house is full and with many orders in line). The food is amazing! One of the best picanhas in Su00e3o Paulo&#39;s rechaud and other delicious side dishes and dishes. They know how to innovate too, always keeping the menu updated with new options and maintaining the constant renovation of the establishment. Regarding drinks, there is a great diversity of chopps (always cold) and they are made to the customer&#39;s needs (little collar, normal or too collar) just ask! Very tasty caipirinhas, without the exaggeration of alcohol or sugar as in many places. A 10 bar and restaurant!",1,1
"Nice beachy chic atmosphere, I ate the truffled shrimp risotto, divine Despite the high price, it is worth it. There was so much shrimp on the plate that I almost couldn&#39;t take it. Positive point also for the seafood buffet.",0,1
"Having a drink at the end of the day with this view, it really is something incredible to do in Su00e3o Paulo. Prices are not cheap, but the place is worth it. Sit in a chair by the pool with your drink! I recommend it and have been back several times.",0,1
"Very good restaurant. Variety on the menu, including kids dishes. Excellent service, in particular from the waiter Allan, very attentive. Super recommended for those who are touring in Maceiu00f3.",1,1
"Have a few drinks that is undoubtedly the best in Recife and eat that Mediterranean Octopus a show, another delicious snack is the crunchy shrimp.",0,1
"Space with cordial service, offering good meals at a satisfactory cost. In addition, it is well located.",1,1
"I&#39;ve been here since I was little. I love the gratin capeletti. Capeletti in brodo and parmegiana are great choices, but all foods are excellent. The service is fantastic. Worth knowing.",1,1
"I recommend, we were well attended by all the staff, especially by Alice, a kind and professional girl.",1,1
"Dishes well prepared and served, serve 3 people well, note service 10, the attendant &quot;Ana Paula&quot; and is an example of a professional, Congratulations to all for the harmonization of the dishes.",0,1
"I happened to enter the restaurant which is hidden behind a house under renovation in Higienu00f3polis, next to the Shopping. Super charming !! I sat at 2 X on the balcony, since the inside is more disputed. Great food! A ravioli with shrimp and truffled oil to eat while kneeling. My mother ordered gnocchi, loved it and my husband the lobster. All cheap dishes to Su00e3o Paulo&#39;s standard and divine! Super recommend!",1,1
"As a descendant of Italian, I really like the pasta that is served at Spoleto, in addition to what you choose how you want the dish, sauce, side dishes, and the price is average.",0,1
"Good for u201chaving a drinku201d with friends, cheap and cold beer. Service a little time, I believe because of the full tent, but at least do not charge 10%. Excellent starters!",1,1
"When taking my family to lunch, one of the people who was at my table, started to feel sick, I decided to taste the sauce, I found that the sauce was sour. I went to speak to the manager, and I was completely ignored. I am sure that I will not return to this place again.",1,-1
"Have lunch facing the sea, not with the breeze on your face. The food is well served, the dishes are for two people and the yummy was great. The ladies who attend were a love",1,1
I always come back when I come to Rio. Ambience delights! Great food! Excellent location and service. I recommend,1,1
"Cozy atmosphere, great location, great food. The shrimp in pineapple serves two people very well and is really worth tasting.",1,1
The service is perfect. The variety of snacks is huge and very tasty. I recommend the pork knee or the sun meat with rennet cheese. The location is great inside a big city mall.,1,1
"The main dishes with a maximum price of R $ 35.00 show how expensive other restaurants in BH charge! Gennaro proves that it is possible to make quality food at a fair price, very fair! The wines at prices of 40 and 50 reais have also never seen in other restaurants. We had a 40.00 Portuguese wine which was great! Our dishes were wonderful, we loved the risotto! And finally, the Petit gateau, besides being beautiful, was perfect! We were very well attended by the waiter, the only thing I didn&#39;t know was that the waiters didn&#39;t take orders for main course, only the maitre d &#39;! Haha it may be a problem when the house is fuller, but in our case we didn&#39;t have to wait long!",1,1
"We went for a pizza and the waiter overheard us saying it was our son&#39;s birthday. He asked if we would allow a tribute and brought a fun cotton candy cake for us to sing congratulations. Place with super cold beer, good pizza and delicacy in the service. Very good.",1,1
"Pub style bar, with music and a diverse beer menu, of various styles. The attendants give you tips on which beer to choose. I recommend the visit to have different beers",1,0
"Excellent restaurant, with helpful, quick and polite waiters, where they even gave me a menu to take to the hotel and when I came back for lunch I had already chosen the order. Prices excellent. First class food, with great seasoning and quantity.",1,1
"Self service restaurant with barbecue. Simple and delicious food, with the right seasoning. Fair price and quality sum up the house.",1,1
"I went with a friend and ordered the fried fish. Two very large pieces of yellow hake came. There is plenty of rice, salad and black-eyed beans, all very tasty! The pitcher of P juice comes with a good amount, the pineapple with mint is very well made, as well as the strawberry caipirosca (one of the best prices I found in the city too). The waiter Gilmar is very attentive, very helpful and very friendly!",0,1
"ample place, great service and food! ideal place for business meetings and to book events on site, it has two floors and offers an option to book events, the decor is very cozy.",1,1
Restaurant with a very good quality buffet service. Very pleasant atmosphere and very well decorated. Very good service. Fair price.,1,1
"Super cool, relaxed and beautiful place. Good service, and pizza, of course, very good. For those who like thin crust, this is the best. Suggestion for tenderloin pizza with chutney.",1,1
"The atmosphere is pleasant and welcoming. The extremely attentive and helpful attendant, grade ten. The dishes are small portions, French style and the prices are high for what they serve. However, they are well presented and tasty. Cost x benefit does not pay.",0,1
"Good Gourmet Menu! Sensational empanada! Entrecot at the requested point, wonderful! Delicious dessert! Pleasant environment! Attentive service! To come back!",1,1
"Get there early, as 13h already had a queue and it was not high season. The place is cozy, facing the sea and there is a wide choice of dishes based on seafood. Almost all dishes are for two people and are very well served. We ordered a breaded shrimp with cashew nuts, my wife and I couldn&#39;t handle the dish. The desserts are too much, we left the place wanting more.",0,1
"Without the glamor of the big restaurants, the chicken is an excellent option for those who like good food and hate queues. Service is great, nice place and still has space for children .... I recommend!",1,1
"With perfect service, to taste a typical chicken with accompaniment of wonderful pasta to choose the sauce.",1,1
"Good place to have a quiet lunch, good music, excellent service from waiters Abrau00e3o, Mota and Selma. In addition to having ample parking.",1,1
"The restaurant is beautiful, the location is incredible, the view breathtaking, but the service .... mega slow. Approx 1h to come drink and food. Poor service excellence makes it expensive to be there. Two starters, a roska + a shot of vodka: R $ 229.00. If the experience was good, it would even be worth ... obs: we stayed in the external area",1,1
"is one of the most frequent restaurants in porto alegre. the price is fair, even on weekends, very varied and delicious food. a pity that they no longer serve the free juice.",1,1
Kei is an excellent restaurant and is located in a trendy neighborhood at night. Great place to meet friends and see the movement of the neighborhood.,1,1
"With a lot of variety, including for salad fans, the restaurant innovates daily by changing its menu. Fixed, only the salads and their components and the grills, everything else changes every day. Of excellent quality, although with a somewhat salty price, it has good service, beautiful atmosphere and cozy space.",1,1
"strategically located at the top of the city, it has a beautiful view of Todos os Santos Bay, the restaurant serves delicious French cuisine. It is worth a visit for two.",1,1
"Good service, good food .. including hot dishes .. good atmosphere and common price in the region.",1,1
"Excellent option, with great dishes, good quality service, great location and always very busy.",1,1
"Staff totally unprepared. Bad service, rude waiters, poorly made drinks. Quite different from the Su00e3o Paulo unit. I do not recommend!",1,-1
"The new room was beautiful with a mix of rustic and classic, the vertical garden brought life to the place. I find this comparison mania between restaurants a bit boring, each place has its differential or seasoning and that&#39;s it. The dishes are delicious, the dessert too, first class service and a very pleasant environment.",1,1
"Where you will find food with less fat, but with a very high price. Compared to other parts of the world where there is Subway here in Belo Horizonte, your meal does not cost less than R $ 15.00, not including the drink. But I think that sometimes we can give ourselves this pleasure. Thinking of the long lines that we now find, the restaurant has many options for healthy food. Employees who sometimes seem to be in a bad mood, or even offer extras that you are not in the mood for, such as chips or cookies, will be able to spend there with their friends who will find a nice place, where the bathroom is shared.",0,1
"Once again I had the pleasure of tasting the best meat in BH! My friend Lorenzo, the owner, masterfully runs the establishment! Well trained, attentive waiters, first class service! The dishes, however, can be ordered by anyone, as he chooses all ingredients and has professionals specialized in the preparation! Anyway, I am a loyal and very satisfied customer! It&#39;s really worth it! I pay with great pleasure!",1,1
"I love San Marino&#39;s pizzas, pleasant atmosphere and super attentive waiters, the pizzas are wonderful !!!!",1,1
"It serves well, the service is very fast and the food is excellent. The only problem is the huge queues, even the preferred ones.",1,1
"In Pescadero I find some spices that are difficult to find elsewhere. In addition, they have a selection of interesting wines, with several options of accompaniments in the cold cuts section. There are also some less common beers, but in smaller quantities when compared to other places. I love the ingredients they sell to make a carpaccio. The sauce and the blade of meat are absurdly good!",1,1
It is worth visiting and buying fresh fish and seafood and even tasting them on the spot. Pack the frozen goods for travel. And the prices are great.,0,1
"you shouldn&#39;t expect much, other than the traditional one served in local bars. worth the price. the beer is very cold. good for a friday with many friends.the steak and fries is the best option.",0,1
"The menu in the kitchen, pizzeria or bar is surprising! Congratulations to chef Ricardo Weiser and his entire team. I highly recommend it.",1,1
"Great cuisine, and great variety of options, typical foods, desserts and delicious sweets. Good service!",1,1
"One of the best restaurants in town, for those who love a good barbecue of great quality. The dishes are excellent and the prices are well suited to what is offered. Great atmosphere for lunch, dinner or happy hour to be with friends or something more romantic. The service from the waiters is satisfactory. Because it is a popular place, it can be difficult to get a parking space depending on the time. But it&#39;s worth it for its great cuisine.",1,1
"Very cool place with the theme of motorcycles, varied menu for all tastes, great cost benefit, impeccable service.",1,1
"Reservation is recommended to avoid queues. The place is cozy, the music is great and the service is what leaves a little to be desired (it could be better). The pizzas are very good and diverse. Very good wine list.",1,1
"Delicious hamburgers, fast and fast service. Excellent experience. In my opinion and that of friends who frequent it, Sampa&#39;s best snack bar / hamburger shop.",1,1
"We went via Restaurant Week and had the opportunity to eat some dishes. What most attracted our attention in a positive way was the seasoning of the dishes and the dessert. Local and small, it is worth arriving early. I want to come back one day to try the carvery.",0,1
"To end an excellent Carnival, we again insist on having dinner at Pereira on an Ash Wednesday. In the previous year, the experience had not been good - dishes exchanged and with missing ingredients, but we were betting that it had been a point out of the curve for having gone before and everything went well. But this last time they overcame it: the main dishes took an hour and forty minutes to be served !!! This is after we complain and threaten to leave. This without any explanation or apology from the staff of the house. Despite being a restaurant that whenever I go / go when I&#39;m in Salvador, it is a warning not to risk ruining your night with a wrong choice.",0,1
"Super cool setting for a lunch with friends, the menu has many American food options. I tasted the famous hibb&#39;s and wings and I really liked the flavor! Ahh, the price of the meals is great too hahaha",1,1
"It was great. Great atmosphere for couples and families. Food ball show. A very cozy atmosphere, very soft ambient sound and great lighting.",1,1
"Handmade pizza with good service. There is always a queue at the door, but it doesn&#39;t usually take long to get a table (at least as a couple). The pizzas arrive warm and very fast on the table. Last time, we ordered Mamma Jamma and Parma Dolcci (with apricot jam and parma ham). The waiter brought us a special olive oil to harmonize with Parma Dolcci. One of the best pizza orders in RJ.",0,1
"Excellent service, very good children&#39;s park. Maitre Maciel and waiter Fu00e1bio give us excellent service! All the best!",1,1
"I met Aconchego Carioca when I was still a dirty bar in the same street. The food was good and the price was fair. It became famous and moved (to a house across the street, with more space and air conditioning), but I was disappointed in this new visit after a few years. The waiter&#39;s service was below criticism. I don&#39;t know if they no longer care about customers being well served, because the fame he created must attract people (who was having lunch there on the same day was ClaudeTroisgros, at a table with several people). To start, we ordered a portion of the famous feijoada dumpling (whose price is very high - R $ 25.00 for a portion with 4 dumplings) and as a main dish a baiu00e3o de dois. The portion of dumplings took about 15 minutes to arrive, but the main course took almost 50 minutes to be served !!!! Even though I asked the waiter about 3 times if it would take too long and received the same answer: &quot;it&#39;s already leaving!&quot; - without even having gone to check. Then I ordered 2 coffees, the leftover in a warm one and the bill. He simply forgot about the coffee and, after 10 minutes I asked again and he said &quot;Ah! The coffee ...&quot; and served us the coffee and handed us our warm to the other table (we had to say it was ours). The bill, of course, nothing. And he came and went everywhere without asking to close our account. My wife got up and went to the cashier, that&#39;s when he said &quot;the bill !!!&quot; and the cashier closed the account in less than 5 seconds (it was only the individual who asked to close it). We paid (of course, without the 10%) and, after more than an hour and a half, we managed to get out of there, having eaten reasonably well, but with terrible service and expensive prices. The food was good, but not at a level that we could classify as exceptional or unmissable ... The owner was there, but she was more concerned with paying attention to Claude and his friends than seeing how the regular customers (who paid for the food) ) were being served. Disappointing.",1,1
Excellent menu of Italian food with pasta and pizza. The calzone is also wonderful. One of the best gnocchi I&#39;ve ever eaten. The dough is homemade and very tasty. The pizza menu is also quite varied and delicious.,1,1
"As an excellent regional restaurant. But this is not a regional restaurant, but a mix of regional / traditional / tourist / international and may even include contemporary delicacies / gourmets / damoda and others in its category. Varied and special dishes on a menu that already makes your mouth water and the eagerness of how it will taste. Tasty starters that differ from the sameness of other restaurants. Wonderful hot chick: said the waiter, be the flagship. Pleasant atmosphere, tables made of wooden trunks give the environment an Amazonian air. At the entrance a small carpet cleans feet, out of step with the risk of slips that can go to the regulars. Wine list compatible with the house specialties. Good quality customer service. I will come back and recommend ..",1,1
"Tereza&#39;s house is for me the best in Salvador! Starting with the location, in the most bohemian neighborhood of Salvador, in an old house, with rustic decor, accompanied by the sound of a grand piano, which harmonizes so well with the exquisite menu. It goes beyond a gastronomic experience. &quot;See, hear, feel&quot; ... Bahian cuisine under a sensitive and daring touch makes this restaurant exceptional.",1,1
"The first dish I ordered did not have, the second came after half an hour, even though the restaurant was empty and was salty ... (shrimp hideaway) but the atmosphere is pleasant and the waiters are friendly and attentive",0,1
"I ended up coming here without having programmed myself, because the bar at the front was packed. but I was surprised. I didn&#39;t know yet. the place has interesting, charming lighting, the attendants are polite, the food is good. I found the price a little high when compared to the size of the pieces, but nothing that hindered the experience. They could improve the drinks part. I will be back for sure.",1,1
"Wide variety of regional food, juices and desserts and of excellent quality. Pleasant and comfortable environment. There is a constant concern with cleanliness in all environments. Staff are friendly and serve well. I recommend!",1,1
"Quality Arab food! Be sure to try the toshcas (pita bread stuffed and grilled), numerous flavors. The fried kebab stuffed with cheese is also divine!",1,1
The pizza is delicious! The atmosphere is perfect for dinner with friends or family. The always attentive waiters make all the difference. Highly recommend the table 7 pizza! Wonderful!,1,1
"Lorita has charm, great cuisine and good taste. Chef Roberta is always attentive and the menu is updated regularly, depending on the season. In the summer you can have dinner under the vines. In winter, in the heat of the fireplace.",1,1
"Many very expensive beers. I usually try different beers on my travels and at home too. Without a doubt, this was the place with the most expensive labels I have ever encountered. Result: you get discouraged and don&#39;t try everything you would like. The values are so unrealistic, that a very ordinary Uruguayan beer, sold in markets, is charged with the value of 3 times that practiced anywhere else. There is nothing on site to justify the prices. Beside you will find better bars and prices to match. A feather.",1,-1
"Very good snack, excellent service, pleasant place and recommended for all ages, super clean.",1,1
"All wonderful. Personalized service, a good atmosphere and wonderful food. I will recommend it to all friends. I ate the paella and it was delicious.",1,1
"We took a lot of acai, all very good, clean and very pleasant place, with attendants well disposed to good service.",1,1
I was with friends on a wonderful late afternoon. Very well attended by Gustavo and entitled to a sunset worthy of a picture frame.,1,1
"excellent steakhouse, air-conditioned, in the city center, including an attached hotel at reasonable prices. worth it",0,1
"Affordable price and good service. Local cuisine. The day I went, the service took a while, but it was acceptable.",0,1
"Great option for happy hour, lunch or dinner! Fair prices, tasty dishes and a relaxed atmosphere. It is recommended to arrive early, the place is quite crowded.",1,1
Really expect more after reading so many comments. The decor could be more neat. Well-served dishes and reasonable price,0,1
"Despite the fame, I found no difference, for the price charged. I honestly went with great expectation, but I came back frustrated.",0,1
"Excellent to go with the family! Great food, pleasant atmosphere, good service and parking. worth knowing",1,1
Excellent food and service (Vanderlei) as always. I recommend coming on Thursday. Wine list 50%.,1,1
"The place is very beautiful and has beers from other countries, but the prices are very salty and the service was not the best.",0,1
"This restaurant also has a unit located within the Rio Branco airport. At this location, lunch is a self-service type with plenty of meat and other dishes. The place is air conditioned and very quiet so you can have a meal before or after traveling.",0,-1
"I&#39;ve been to this place twice, but I regretted it both times. At first I went and didn&#39;t like it, I tried the second, but it remained the same. The waiters are poorly oriented, offer rotation, but are unable to meet the demand. Hots are cold and sushi comes with a lot more rice than salmon.",0,-1
It was the second time I went to the restaurant! It was renovated! I called making the reservation that for lunch which is until 15:00 we ended up being late because the group was large and they were waiting for us even after the hours! Super abundant wonderful food and very affordable price! It is worth mentioning that the rapadura ice cream and the capim santo ice cream are wonderful! I recommend!,1,1
"Porcu00e3o has its highlight, but it is not the best carvery in BH! Good for those who love rare meat (which goes on all the time) and not so much for those who prefer better done (which sometimes have to ask to pass). Variety of salads and good sushi !! Very good and attentive service! Very strange entrance after the &#39;renovation&#39;, but the main environment was very beautiful! The option to park is in the parking lot just because Avenida Raja is complicated ...",1,1
"My family and I love to eat pizzas, Portuguese and pepperoni. Our favorites !!!! But, we were thinking of returning to try other flavors, because we saw other people eating with great pleasure. We&#39;ll be back soon.",0,1
"We went three times during our stay in Cameroon! The delicious dishes are the best for me, the shrimp at Jerimum ... A delight and the portions are overly plentiful! Great place for those who want to get enough paying a super fair price!",1,1
Kei is an excellent restaurant and is located in a trendy neighborhood at night. Great place to meet friends and see the movement of the neighborhood.,1,1
"If you want a quiet place to have lunch in the middle of the chaos of the city center, this is the place! The tables are in a wooded place and then worth a visit to the Anchieta Museum, with works from the Jesuit era, sacred art and also a visit to the old crypt. Very interesting!",0,1
"Super traditional Teresina restaurant for being a specialist in a super typical dish with sun meat. Very good sun meat, accompanies an incredible cassava in the butter of the earth with a super unique sauce sweetened with tomato. Nice environment, there are two of them in city, the best located is on the east side of the city on one of the main avenues. Worth the visit",1,1
"We went to this restaurant on my husband&#39;s birthday in March this year. The restaurant itself is impeccable! In all senses. The service is outstanding and the food is fantastic. The dishes are very well served, three people eat a dish well. And taking that into account it doesn&#39;t even come as expensive as some say. We think that the prices are very fair. The cod shell (crab shell style, but made of cod) is sensational, and the fried cod skin that they offer as a courtesy takes away a wonderful flavor. We don&#39;t even have anything to say about the dishes. The best cod we have ever eaten in Vitu00f3ria was certainly in the fireplace. Parking is complicated, but they have valet service, but we took a taxi because we took a bottle of wine. As it was my husband&#39;s birthday, we took a cake to sing congratulations and they were very receptive and took care of our cake and at the time of congratulations they even provided a candle, as I had forgotten. About our wine, in the fireplace they do not charge a cork (fee that restaurants normally charge to take your own wine) and even then the waiter opens your bottle, puts the wine in a decanter to breathe and serves ... this did with that the restaurant won a lot of points for us. In most restaurants they turn up their noses when you take your wine even though they charge a fee. Their wine list is very good, but as we didn&#39;t know and it was a special date, my husband wanted to take a special wine that we bought on a trip. For me it&#39;s worth the visit.",1,1
"Pleasant atmosphere, service from the staff left nothing to be desired, good quality food and very fair price",1,1
"Impeccable service, delicious food and a very pleasant atmosphere. At lunch the buffet is super varied and the grilled came in the perfect spot. At dinner the menu is excellent! There is always a security guard at the door, which for me is a very favorable point in Belu00e9m. Whenever I go to Belu00e9m, I eat at least one meal at Santa. I recommend!!",1,1
"very good pizzas, responsive and fast service, very fast delivery. Differentiated quality. I recommend .",1,1
"With this cold weather, there is nothing better than going to a kiosk or shop at Casa do Pu00e3o de Queijo to taste its warm, fluffy and extremely tasty breads, accompanied by a cup of coffee. A delight!",1,1
"Fixed variable charge according to the day of the week. Soups, salads, pasta, grills, juices and water at will. Exceptional service. We love it !!",1,1
"Excellent service, extremely attentive people, very good food, pleasant waiting time. I recommend",1,1
"Unique restaurant. There you will find flavors and ingredients typical of other regions of Brazil, such as pequi and others. Service by the chef and owner. It is not cheap but worth knowing.",1,1
"I love Toshca Arabian. All the stores are great and the quality is excellent. My favorite is the traditional Toscha. It&#39;s very tasty. Just don&#39;t order pineapple juice with mint, as mint is not natural. It looks like powder juice. They could improve that huh !!!",1,1
"The pizza is good, but expensive. For a tasting it is worth it, but to get enough you will need to order at least one whole pizza for yourself.",0,1
"I marveled at the cleanliness of the place since it was a bar by the sea and subject to the &quot;pass-through&quot; of people by the sidewalk. The cuisine only focused on thefts from the sea, also offers well served sandwiches.",0,-1
"The Arab restaurant has food per kilo and a fair price for its first class food, the last dish available is the lamb shank, a ten meat, divine.",0,1
"The air conditioning is not pleasant and I observed carelessness in cleaning the tablecloth. However, it has tasty pizzas and kind service.",1,1
"Initially we were already surprised by the impeccable service of Jou00e3o, a smiling, kind, polite and very knowledgeable young man about all the information on the menu, solving all our doubts with mastery !!!! The pizza was another pleasant surprise, WONDERFUL! Explosion of flavor! We will definitely be back at the house when we return to Curitiba! Congratulations!!!",1,1
"Usually a busy restaurant, but with a quick queue, delicious food, worth every penny!",0,1
"The place at night is wonderful for any type of social gathering, with fantastic views of part of Rio de Janeiro.",1,1
"When you look for healthy food outside the home and pay a high price for it, you expect a differential. This does not exist in the establishment. I have already tasted 3 dishes and none of them pleased me. All with ingredients easily found in supermarkets and without any house sauce or anything special.",1,1
"I had already visited similar restaurants in Rio de Janeiro, but this one was special! Very pleasant atmosphere with beautiful decor (I love emporiums!) And very polite and friendly staff! My boyfriend and I had not made a reservation (which was necessary because it was Valentine&#39;s Day) but we were very well attended and placed at a table, waiting less than 10 minutes! Very tasty meat, at the point I requested! Accompanied by canoe potato (sequinha) and a delicious farofa !! Highlight for the chimichurri that was perfect !! The menu is very varied, with many options of cuts! The price is right for the quality and quantity of the portions! My experience at La Macellaria was a top 10 !!",1,1
"Excellent confectionery in Su00e3o Luu00eds, with a wide variety of pies, including an order service. Waltz dream pie recommendation, delicious.",1,1
"The place is really cool! A house transformed into a restaurant, very well decorated and with a picturesque air, gives the impression that sooner or later the owners of the house will sit at the table to eat together with us. And the fish, well the fish is delicious. I tried the tambaqui without bones and I was extremely satisfied.",1,1
"A very cozy atmosphere, excellent for a dinner for two. The service is very good. The dishes we tasted were delicious. The prices charged are a little high, however, it is worth the visit.",1,1
Very good pizzeria and even went on a day of rotating pizza and pasta. I liked quality and service was not good.,1,1
"Excellent meals, divine dishes and the best service in Brasilia, prices vary according to customers&#39; choice.",1,1
"Meal serves very well the number of people proposed by the menu, pleasant atmosphere, very good service, waiters and other employees always very helpful, easy access place",1,1
"Super famous in Leblon, Veloso is always packed. Good option both for a post-beach lunch (excellent food), as well as to go out at night to chat and flirt with friends or warm up for a night out. The highlight of the bar is public, there are a lot of beautiful people having a beer on the sidewalk. Better than a lot of ballads in Rio. The service is ok and the prices are in the average of Rio. Both the draft beer and the original beer are always very cold and the snacks are all delicious.",1,1
"Very well located in the best part of the seashore of Fortaleza. very &quot;turist&quot; place, but of excellent quality. somewhat high prices.",0,1
"Really being in Jou00e3o Pessoa and not visiting Mangai is like not having been in this city, because this restaurant is a nice differential for those who enjoy eating well and in a pleasant environment.",1,1
"Like basically every restaurant in Brazil, vegetarians and especially vegans are sick. there are very few options: white rice and lettuce, tomatoes and carrots, which is what I usually eat when I have lunch there. Apparently the options for those who eat meat are great, because I saw the people lounging, but for me, it was a very bad experience and I only went because it was the least worst in the place. The service is not bad, however.",1,-1
"A good place to eat crab, fish or even snacks like codfish balls or breaded cheese",1,1
"I really liked my choice (Bu00e1k Gigante), very tasty, well located, the preparation took a little time, but it was worth it. The price is fair, very comfortable and organized. I recommend!",1,1
"Excellent meals, divine dishes and the best service in Brasilia, prices vary according to customers&#39; choice.",1,1
Despite the steep price the Hur pizza is a great option for lovers of good pizza. Excellent pasta and has the option of edge I recommend the pizza hut,1,1
"TripAdvisor, correct the price information for this place! We ordered a portion of risotto dumpling which was ok. There are 4 tiny dumplings (the size of an olive) that cost 32.00! As a dish, we shared a moqueca (the dish is individual but we refuse to pay too much) which was good. The price is 89.00 !! To drink, two cokes, because the juices (14.00) and the drinks (minimum 30.00) were very expensive. The total bill was 160.00, with 13% of service! It&#39;s not worth the price.",0,1
"We ask for the rodizio at the end of the week, in the amount of 35, 40 reais. We were very well attended, and served with few types of meat, but all meats very well prepared and served.",0,1
"If you visit Goiu00e2nia, enjoy the late afternoon to see many beautiful people circulating in the park&#39;s lake. In the neighborhood it&#39;s full of bars and stuff. Kabanas is the highlight of the region. Your kitchen has been awarded a few times, but it is good to go with your wallet prepared. There are cheaper options, and also very busy and cool, over there. But if you can, be sure to enjoy it. You can start work in the beer garden, facing the lake, and then end the night with a beautiful dish and great wine - one of the best wine lists in the capital.",1,1
"For me, Fogo de Chu00e3o&#39;s great differential is the service. The service is exceptional and the cuts are delicious. The atmosphere is very pleasant and has a very good wine list. In fact, it was in this unit that I got to know Alma Negra Mystery wine and never more than buy another one. Lovely wine.",1,1
"The atmosphere is very nice and is the biggest highlight in the place. Service, also very good. The cuisine, which was the greatest expectation, if it did not disappoint, also did not excite. Yummy, no doubt, but without the extra I expected. Worth the visit and possibly the return, but without the excitement of the experimentation.",1,1
"Excellent service, lots of food and drink options, air-conditioned environment. The waiter Leandro very helpful and available to serve his customers.",1,1
"The food is self-service around the wood stove, with that typical food from Minas Gerais, from the fields, with the ham, the cheese bread, the tutu, the fried cabbage, the sausage, the paio, the torresminho etc etc",1,-1
A good atmosphere ... With an excellent pizza ... It is very worthwhile to go with friends ... I really like it ... I recommend easy ... Besides having pizza with regional products ...,1,1
We went for family dinner and were very well attended. The pizza you can choose the thickness of the dough and it is just very tasty! It is worth going and trying it out.,0,1
I really enjoyed going to the crab. A super nice bar. Good food. Good service. Good location in Salvador. I indicate this bar without any restrictions. Cool. I loved it. I will come back for sure. Super indication.,1,1
"is a great restaurant, especially on weekends where the variety of dishes is splendid. The atmosphere is very good, attentive service, the desserts are FROM THE GODS ..",1,1
The food took a long time and came in parts. It is not able to deliver simple appetizers! Also an insect was found in the children&#39;s play area and the score was so wrong we will be back.,0,-1
"Unrivaled food, tasteful rustic decor and top with sea views. International shrimp is always a good option, very well served and delicious. Prices are high, not unlike other restaurants in Beira Mar, however it does not charge 10%. It is worth a visit.",0,1
"Pleasant atmosphere, typical Italian menu where the strongest are the pasta, but you also find meat, fish and chicken, as well as salads and entrees. The Italian bread, which comes hot on the table, with the olive oil served in a separate dish is unbeatable. The service could be much more careful. It does not compromise, but leaves something to be desired. The portions are good and have a specific menu for children, which makes it a lot easier. Coffee should not be dispensed, as it is very tasty.",1,1
"The tapiocas are very good and the atmosphere is very pleasant, although small. The decoration is reminiscent of the &quot;northeastern&quot; and has themed hats for those who want to take pictures. We don&#39;t like the egg pancake. On the other hand, Italian straw tapioca is very tasty. Great for those who love candy.",1,1
"Very good snack, excellent service, pleasant place and recommended for all ages, super clean.",1,1
"I looked for the tip here on tripadvisor and it was perfect! I tried a reservation at 20:00 but it didn&#39;t happen. We went straight and arrived at 20:30, with a queue for 2 people of 30 min. It was worth every minute of the wait! Location, service, food ... everything perfect. I highly recommend it!",1,1
"Food was very good, atmosphere super nice, I consider it a great option for dinner for two on special occasions.",1,1
"We went with friends to visit the restaurant, influenced by Jacquin&#39;s signature. In fact, the food is wonderful and the garnish is very plentiful. Eat at ease (except for meat) ... we left very happy, lol! I leave my compliments and compliments to the waiter Fernando, Barbacenense, who very kindly served us. Connoisseur of dishes, preparations and wines! My grade was just not excellent due to the final price ... if the meat was more abundant, certainly, top grade!",1,1
"Pleasant atmosphere, lively music, it is very worthwhile to try the dried meat topped with butter, delicious ..",1,1
"For Sunday lunches the buffet is per kilo, with very good food, in a great atmosphere. They usually have live piano. It also offers desserts per kg. It has a small parking lot. The food is very varied, even for those who are very demanding.",0,1
"Excellent the restaurant, from the decoration to the dishes .... the dessert then ends with style. My mom loved everything, which is difficult .... I recommend",1,1
"I went to this restaurant three times during my stay in Maceiu00f3. The first time was at the beachfront unit, more sophisticated, with dishes identical to the other, but more expensive. The food was not the best, but it was reasonably good. I ordered a cod and my husband, prawns with potatoes au gratin. Our second experience was at the unit on the beach promenade. Out of curiosity, we ordered a mini Shrimp Gum. Honestly, I was amazed that this was the flagship of the restaurant. Even though it is a small portion, my husband, my daughter and I cannot eat everything. Extremely strong and greasy! The last time, to close with a flourish, we went to dinner in this unit of the boardwalk. I ordered a spaghetti with fillet in a sugo sauce, unmatchable ... raw pasta and the tomato sauce looked like lemon, it was so acid! My husband&#39;s dish, ditto! Raw rice, raw vegetables and lots of fat. The fish, although tasty, was very small.",0,1
"It seems to be being disabled. Unaware, I went to lunch at la plank, but it doesn&#39;t work there anymore. I missed the trip.",0,-1
"Super nice atmosphere, great service, wonderful food and served in a huge quantity and at a very fair price. I recommend the international shrimp!",1,1
"Cariri&#39;s main lounge has several tables and, at the end of the day, there is always live music, which makes the atmosphere super lively! For those who want to dance, there is a ballroom further down that works at night with forru00f3 (but in the main hall even many people usually get up from their tables to dance!) Just from getting very full, the waiters are able to serve you in an attentive and prompt manner! I recommend the siriguela caipi: delicious!",1,1
"Plenty of salads, grills and hot dishes. The danger is overeating. All very tasty and fast and efficient boxes.",1,1
"We went to Money Money at the end of our events in Cuiabu00e1, we wanted a relaxed, cheap and not too noisy place: bingo! Super good service, cold beer, generous portions, all very good! Oh and the super fair price, in addition to having a wonderful kids space, if you have children, this is the place! Thanks Money Money ...",1,1
"The Coco Bambu Restaurant is one of the most sought after in the city. Offers a wide menu, with emphasis on shrimp and lobsters. I tried the coconut shrimp dish, very good! and very fed up too. For three people. Good draft beer and pleasant atmosphere by the sea. Worth knowing!",0,1
"I was attended by the waiter Luiz Fernando, very attentive and helpful. Very tasty food and full of varieties !!!",1,1
"I arrived at Unique at night and tried to dine at Skye, but I couldn&#39;t, because it was completely packed on Tuesday. But I had the opportunity to have lunch there and I can only say that everything is divine and wonderful, starting with the starter, with sensational homemade rolls, followed by a basic dish, but very well done: a chorizo steak accompanied by garlic bread, farofa of egg, roasted pupunha heart of palm and vinaigrette. For dessert, I ordered a Nespresso accompanied by a creme brulee of mate tea, a macaron and a chocolate almond Rocher. Note 9!",1,1
"Nice atmosphere, but nothing extraordinary. I took some chopps and ate a fish ... the fish was delicious",1,1
"An amazing place to exchange ideas with friends. Very cold beer, delicious burger, great entrees and impeccable service. Good music ... I recommend it!",1,1
"It has a well-designed menu, with everything authentic from Japanese food. The buffet is very good. The waiters&#39; attention is also impressive, trying to put the customer at ease. Only prices could be lower.",1,1
"Very delicious food and very good atmosphere! The restaurant wins the clientele with an exaggerated offer of carbohydrates (Ex: rice and pasta), while the amount of meat / fish / fruits is not proportional. Go",1,1
"Beautiful location with a varied menu with economical options, it is not a cutting-edge gastronomy place but makes up for it with professional and fast service and a wonderful wine list for the options and varied price offer",1,1
"I&#39;ve been at Piero for a long time. That week (03/26/2014) I had the opportunity to return home and I did not regret it. Very good, great food as always !!!",1,1
"I was at the pizzeria recently, I ordered the flavors I always ask for; arugula with parma and chicken with curd. When the pizza arrived I was disappointed because I was used to the quality and care of the pizzeria. The parma pizza did not arrive as usual, before I ordered and arrived at the table with plenty of parma, living up to the flavor, the last time I ordered, pieces of parma came and moreover they did not share the flavors equally, adding more pizza chicken. If it is to save parma, it would be more efficient to get it off the menu soon. The pizza was even aesthetically poor, not consistent with the value of almost 70 reais that is charged, a value that I did not think was unfair for the quality, but that now does not fit. As for chicken, they substituted smoked chicken (which was much tastier) with regular chicken. The pizza was not bad, but I was used to it much more beautiful and tasty. I will return with less expectations and with the hope that I went on a bad day. The service and the environment are still very good.",1,-1
Top 4 cheese pizza ever. Exemplary service. I will always come back. Cold beer and top waiters. We love the atmosphere and hope to come for lunch,1,1
"If you are looking for a special night, really special menu with honest prices, this is the place. The building is located in the old WINERY 21, A GASTRONOMIC ADDRESS ALREADY KNOWN IN PALMAS. now reformulated Seccondo presents a competent cuisine in the execution and presentation of the dishes as well as a Good WINE CELLAR for accompaniments. One aspect that can improve is the beer list, only national commercial fermentations are commercialized, which limits the gastronomic experience of those seeking harmonization with the beers.",1,1
Nice suggestion from the waiter Picanha on the disc accompanies fried salad (fries and polenta with cheese). It was simply delicious. Desserts sweet d strawberry Sweet good good dlu00e7 I recommend fair price,1,1
"Beautiful place, great service, excellent cuisine, very well frequented place, ample parking, and wonderful views.",1,1
"This restaurant is my favorite here in Su00e3o Paulo and in other cities where I go on business or sightseeing. Very first quality food, many drink options with excellent wines and a top 10 service.",1,1
Where the famous shrimp gum is served very tasty especially for those who like cheese. Very pleasant and sophisticated environment.,1,1
"Good location, varied menu, prices compatible with the standard of the food, family atmosphere. Advantage of having beside a natural restaurant where we can order from the menu of both environments at the same time. Tasty food.",0,1
"The red grill is very well located, simple and airy rustic atmosphere, with ideal light, tailored service, with cold drinks and offers a meat menu in the right measure with variety and very well made. The best and the taste. Just be careful with the point of the meats. Because the point is important for those who appreciate meat. Ask for help if you need it.",1,1
"The service is great, the food has quality and health thanks you. It shows that healthy food can be very tasty. The place is cool and art predominates in the colors that form the designs printed on the walls, tables, etc ... The price, on the other hand, is high, but it is very worth knowing for the quality that the place offers.",0,1
"Beautiful, intimate place, with great different empanadas, several beer labels and very good service.",1,1
"great environments for all audiences, especially lovers of rock, it was where I met people from all over the world",1,1

"Great atmosphere, first class service, but I didn&#39;t like the pizza very much, I went with my daughter and although we loved the place we didn&#39;t find anything special in the pizza.",1,1
"Good food, soft and tasty picanha. Simple environment, inside a gas station. Good service. Reasonable price, about 110 reais a steak for 4 (4 pieces of steak and side dishes).",1,1
"Favorita is a restaurant with separate environments, good for when you want more discretion. Well located but not in the middle of the mess. And of course, the food is very good.",0,1
"Being well received and having the best caipirinha are just details of this bar. Eat: coxinha with pepper sauce, porpeta with dark mustard and steak tartar that besides delicious comes with a super show in the preparation.",1,1
"Simple and unpretentious place in the middle of Ipanema. We ordered filet mignon Oswaldo spider. The filet was in the right spot, almost as soft as butter, with a little bit of garlic, served with rice, egg flour and Portuguese potatoes. Really enjoyed. We ordered sparkling water to accompany and the total bill was $ 108. I recommend!",0,1
"They commented a lot about this place, and we got to know it. We were very well attended by the employees, but that day I think we were unlucky. We ordered a fish stew and it did not meet expectations. The broth is very thin, without any seasoning, the fish was a little rubbery, as if it had not been cooked as it should. Good price, well located, clean and nice place ...",1,1
"Great. Located in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. Offers lunch, snacks, juices, vitamins, milk, soft drinks, among other things. Everything is of the highest quality.",0,1
"I really liked the place, the service was also very good, I asked for a ragu that was tasty but without anything exceptional, I&#39;m going back to try another option.",1,1

"I went to the restaurant because of his participation in the Association of Restaurants of Good Memento and leaves with a good memory, with the certainty that in a new opportunity in Aracaju I will visit him again. The atmosphere is very pleasant. The location outside the area with other restaurants offers pleasant tranquility. The service is very attentive with very friendly waiters as usual in good restaurants in the northeast. The price is in line with the other restaurants of the association and lives up to the quality of the meal served. A great experience. it&#39;s worth visiting",1,1
"Good place for various profiles, both for those who go with the family to lunch, and for those who want to have a cold beer! Highlight for the snacks!",1,-1
