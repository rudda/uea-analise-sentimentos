It is already the third time in this intimate restaurant. Curious and very good cuisine. We always ask for the tasting menu and it is very worthwhile (the 5 course 270 per person and the complete 7 or 8 courses for around R $ 410). The dishes are well prepared and really Gourmets. I recommend it to anyone who wants to taste the dishes.,0.46625000000000005,0.27
"I have been to Jam Itaim more than once, other times the service was very good, but this time it left a lot to be desired. The night was only good because the food was very, very good. The service at the Sushi Bar (counter) was reasonable. I confess that we were disappointed and that when we return to Su00e3o Paulo we will definitely go to Jam Jardins, as we opted for Itaim because we were staying closer to this unit. The waiters were concerned and only serving full tables (certainly concerned with tips and 10% services, including the waiter brought us the note there including the 10% and told us to remove it (he didn't like it) but we didn't get a good one service and yes it comes bad.

"The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere ... however the waiting criterion is unintelligent (not to say dumb). No matter how many people you are in, be it 01, 02 ... or 20) your wait will follow the order, that is, if there is a wait for 20 people and you are in 04 people don't be excited if a table 04 seats ... because by the logic of waiting they will expect to vacate 5 tables of 04 to accommodate the 20 people in front of them. That's why the wait time to sit at the restaurant is at least 03 hours ... that's it. So the restaurant is always packed. Pure marketing. Conclusion: first and last time. Ah ... if the food is good? I do not know how to answer because after 4 hours of waiting in this dynamic super smart anything is a delight.

"My husband and I spent a week in Maceiu00f3, and we went on the last night (14/08/18) to meet Janga. We arrived early, around 7 pm and got a good table. We were very well attended by Jeff, to whom we explained that my husband did not eat fish or seafood, and that I was very eager to eat lobster. The dishes served there are all for two or three people. Jeff offered us the solution of ordering two individual dishes, which are not on the menu. I ordered lobster (two small ones were served) with lemon risotto and my husband ordered a fillet (meat) with cheese rice.The food was delicious, however, as there was a lot of risotto and rice in relation to the protein served, a medium dish for each of us, at least half of each dish was left.The wine served and the dessert were also excellent.The only thing, however, was when we asked for the bill and realized that each dish was charged individually: lobster, meat, risotto and cheese rice for about R $ 40 each dish. That is, we pay around R $ 150, only on the dishes. The dish for 2 people costs 80 to 100 reais.But, as they made an exception, we accepted the value.We will only leave the tip for couples who do not have the same taste for the main course or stop going or get ready to pay the amount that would be for three people.As for Janga, I ask you to evaluate the possibility of serving individual dishes at a fair price, as I realized that several couples have the same problem when trying to go to the restaurant.
