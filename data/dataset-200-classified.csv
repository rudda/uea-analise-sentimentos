"Restaurante Yemanju00e1 is very traditional in Salvador. Faithful to Bahian cuisine, it has an entrance of small, very crunchy acaraju00e9s with a generous portion of vatapu00e1 and dried shrimp. The dishes are well served and the price is fair. OThe atmosphere is very themed and cozy, in addition to impeccable service. As a dessert I suggest the cocada but order the white and burnt mixture. It's delicious. It's worth the experience !!!",1,1,1,1,wagner
"Yesterday my husband made a reservation to celebrate my birthday.At the first contact, they rudely warned that after 8:30 pm the occupation of the tables is on a first come, first served basis. They sent us to the first floor without even showing us the way. We sat down and ordered the menu 3 times. After about 20 minutes we received them and during the choice of dishes I checked the information that they do not accept cards, only checks or cash. An absurdity in the middle of Ipanema and the XXI century. I don't think it's a good idea to have at least R $ 500.00 in your bag, at night in Rio de Janeiro to pay for dinner. We got up and decided to leave for another restaurant. The valet returned the car, all dirty with cement, as they parked it at the Metro construction site. We left for Restaurante D'Amici in Leme, where we were well served, where the grouper ravioli with prawns and saffron sauce was divine.",0,1,0,0,wagner

It was so surprising that I thought it was fair to write this review.Congratulations to the kitchen team for the quality of the dishes. I ordered a filet sandwich with catupiry which was very well served. However, the highlight was the dessert: Petit Gateau de Buriti.

"I have been a customer for years at Velho Rabo and I say that the establishment is the best in the Pompu00e9ia neighborhood.For customers who like the bars in Vila Madalena, try the Old Rabo! He gives 10 to 0 at any bar there.Service is one of the bar / restaurant's strongest points. Managers, employees and even the owner are very friendly, know how to welcome all types of customers and never forget an order. Honesty also adds a positive point, because if any dish is delayed they will tell you exactly why the delay (for example, because the house is full and with many orders in line).The food is amazing! One of the best picanhas in Su00e3o Paulo's rechaud and other side dishes and delicious dishes. They know how to innovate too, always keeping the menu updated with new options and maintaining the constant renovation of the establishment.In relation to drinks, there is a great diversity of draft beer (always cold) and they are made to the measure of the customer (little collar, normal or too collar) just ask! Very tasty caipirinhas, without the exaggeration of alcohol or sugar as in many places.A bar and restaurant 10!",1,1,1,1,wagner

I sat at 2 X on the balcony, since the inside is more disputed. Great food! A ravioli with shrimp and truffled olive oil to eat while kneeling.

"The main dishes with a maximum price of R $ 35.00 show how expensive other restaurants in BH charge! Gennaro proves that it is possible to make quality food at a fair price, very fair!The wines at prices of 40 and 50 reais have also never seen in other restaurants. We had a 40.00 Portuguese wine which was great!Our dishes were wonderful, we loved the risotto! And finally, the Petit gateau, besides being beautiful, was perfect!We were very well attended by the waiter, the only thing I didn't know was that the waiters did not take orders for main course, only the maitre d '!

The dishes are delicious, the dessert too, first class service and a very pleasant environment.",1,1,1,1,wagner
"Where you will find food with less fat, but with a very high price. Compared to other parts of the world where there is Subway here in Belo Horizonte, your meal does not cost less than R $ 15.00, not including the drink. But I think that sometimes we can give ourselves this pleasure. Thinking of the long lines that we now find, the restaurant has many options for healthy food. Employees who sometimes seem to be in a bad mood, or even offer extras that you are not in the mood for, such as chips or cookies, will be able to spend there with their friends who will find a nice place, where the bathroom is shared.",0,1,1,1,wagner
"Once again I had the pleasure of tasting the best meat in BH! My friend Lorenzo, the owner, masterfully runs the establishment! Well trained, attentive waiters, first class service!

"In Pescadero I find some spices that are difficult to find elsewhere. In addition they have a selection of interesting wines, with several options of accompaniments in the cold section. There are also some less common beers, but in smaller quantities when compared to other places. I love the ingredients they sell to put together a carpaccio. The sauce and the blade of meat are absurdly good!",1,1,1,1,wagner

Great atmosphere for lunch, dinner or happy hour to be with friends or something more romantic. The service from the waiters is satisfactory. Because it is a popular place, it can be difficult to get a parking space depending on the time. But it's worth it for its great cuisine.",1,1,1,1,wagner

"To end an excellent Carnival, we again insist on having dinner at Pereira on an Ash Wednesday. In the previous year, the experience had not been good - dishes changed and with missing ingredients, but we were betting that it had been a point out of the curve for having gone before and everything went well. But this last time they overcame it: the main dishes took an hour and forty minutes to be served !!! This is after we complain and threaten to leave. This without any explanation or apology from the staff of the house. Despite being a restaurant that I always go to when I go to Salvador, it is a warning not to risk ruining your night with a wrong choice.",0,1,0,1,wagner

One of the best pizza orders in RJ.",0,1,1,1,wagner
"Excellent service, very good children's park. Maitre Maciel and waiter Fu00e1bio give us excellent service! All the best!",1,1,1,1,rudda
"I met Aconchego Carioca when I was still a dirty bar in the same street. The food was good and the price was fair.It became famous and moved (to a house across the street, with more space and air conditioning), but I was disappointed in this new visit after a few years.The waiter's service was below criticism. I don't know if they no longer care about customers being well served, because the fame he created must attract people (who was having lunch there on the same day was ClaudeTroisgros, at a table with several people).To start, we ordered a portion of the famous feijoada dumpling (the price of which is very high - R $ 25.00 for a portion with 4 dumplings) and as a main dish a baiu00e3o de dois. The portion of dumplings took about 15 minutes to arrive, but the main course took almost 50 minutes to be served !!!! Even though I asked the waiter about 3 times if it would take too long and received the same answer: it's already leaving! - without even having gone to check. Then I ordered 2 coffees, the leftover in a warm one and the bill. He simply forgot about the coffee and, after 10 minutes I asked again and he said Ah! The coffee ... and served us the coffee and handed us our warm to the other table (we had to say it was ours). The bill, of course, nothing. And he came and went everywhere without asking to close our account. My wife got up and went to the cashier, that's when he said: the bill !!! and the cashier closed the account in less than 5 seconds (it was only the individual who asked to close it). We paid (of course, without the 10%) and, after more than an hour and a half, we managed to get out of there, having eaten reasonably well, but with terrible service and expensive prices.The food was good, but not at a level that we could classify as exceptional or unmissable ... The owner was there, but she was more concerned with paying attention to Claude and his friends than seeing how the regular customers (who paid for the food) ) were being served.Disappointing.",0,1,1,1,rudda
Excellent menu of Italian food with pasta and pizza. The calzone is also wonderful. One of the best gnocchi I've ever eaten. The dough is homemade and very tasty. The pizza menu is also quite varied and delicious.,1,1,1,1,rudda
"As an excellent regional restaurant. But this is not a regional restaurant, but a mix of regional / traditional / tourist / international and may even include contemporary delicacies / gourmets / damoda and others in its category. Varied and special dishes on a menu that already makes your mouth water and the eagerness of how it will taste. Tasty starters that differ from the sameness of other restaurants. Wonderful hot chick: said the waiter, be the flagship. Pleasant atmosphere, tables made of wooden trunks give the environment an Amazonian air. At the entrance a small carpet cleans feet, out of step with the risk of slips that can go to the regulars. Wine list compatible with the house specialties. Good quality customer service. I will return and recommend ..",1,1,1,1,rudda
"Tereza's house is for me the best in Salvador! Starting with the location, in the most bohemian neighborhood of Salvador, in an old house, with rustic decor, accompanied by the sound of a grand piano, which harmonizes so well with the elaborate menu.It goes beyond a gastronomic experience. See, hear, feel ...Bahian cuisine under a sensitive and daring touch makes this restaurant exceptional.",1,1,0,0,rudda

I didn't know yet. the place has an interesting, charming lighting, the attendants are polite, the food is good.

"Many very expensive beers.I usually try different beers on my travels and at home too. Without a doubt, this was the place with the most expensive labels I have ever encountered. Result: you get discouraged and don't try everything you would like.The values u200bu200bare so unrealistic that a very ordinary Uruguayan beer, sold in markets, is charged with the value of 3 times that practiced anywhere else.There is nothing on site to justify the prices. Next to it you will find better bars and prices to match.A feather.",1,-1,1,1,rudda

"I've been to this place twice, but I regretted it both times. At first I went and didn't like it, I tried the second, but it remained the same. The waiters are poorly oriented, offer rotation, but are unable to meet the demand. Hots are cold and sushi comes with a lot more rice than salmon.",0,-1,1,1,rudda
It was the second time I went to the restaurant! It was renovated! I called making the reservation that for lunch which is until 15:00 we ended up being late because the group was big and they were waiting for us even after the hours!

"Super traditional Teresina restaurant for being a specialist in a super typical dish of sun meat. Very good sun meat, accompanies an incredible cassava in the butter of the earth with a super unique sauce sweetened with tomato. Nice environment, there are two of them in city, the best located is on the east side of the city on one of the main avenues. Worth visiting",1,1,1,1,rudda
"We went to this restaurant on my husband's birthday in March this year.The restaurant itself is impeccable! In all senses. The service is outstanding and the food is fantastic. The dishes are very well served, three people eat a dish well. And taking that into account it doesn't even come as expensive as some say. We think that the prices are very fair.The cod shell (crab shell style, but made of cod) is sensational, and the fried cod skin that they offer as a courtesy takes away a wonderful flavor. We don't even have anything to say about the dishes. The best cod we have ever eaten in Vitu00f3ria was certainly in the fireplace.Parking is complicated, but they have valet service, but we took a taxi because we took a bottle of wine.As it was my husband's birthday, we took a cake to sing congratulations and they were very receptive and took care of our cake and at the time of congratulations they even provided a candle, as I had forgotten.About our wine, in the fireplace they do not charge a cork (fee that restaurants normally charge to take your own wine) and even then the waiter opens your bottle, puts the wine in a decanter to breathe and serves ... that the restaurant won a lot of points for us. In most restaurants they turn up their noses when you take your wine even though they charge a fee. Their wine list is very good, but as we didn't know it and it was a special date, my husband wanted to take a special wine that we bought on a trip.For me it's worth the visit.",1,1,0,1,rudda

There are 4 tiny dumplings (the size of an olive) that cost 32.00!As a dish, we shared a moqueca (the dish is individual but we refuse to pay too much) which was good.

Kabanas is the highlight of the region. Your kitchen has been awarded a few times, but it is good to go with the prepared wallet. There are cheaper options, and also quite busy and cool, over there. But if you can, be sure to enjoy yourself. You can start work in the beer garden, facing the lake, and then end the night with a beautiful dish and great wine - one of the best wine lists in the capital.",1,1,1,1,rafael
"For me, Fogo de Chu00e3o's great differential is the service. The service is exceptional and the cuts are delicious. The atmosphere is very pleasant and has a very good wine list. In fact, it was in this unit that I got to know Alma Negra Mystery wine and never more than buy another one. Lovely wine.",1,1,1,1,rafael

"Pleasant atmosphere, typical Italian menu where the strongest are the pasta, but you also find meat, fish and chicken, as well as salads and entrees. The Italian bread, which arrives hot on the table, with the olive oil served in a separate dish is unbeatable. The service could be much more careful. It does not compromise, but leaves something to be desired. The portions are good and have a specific menu for children, which makes it a lot easier. Coffee should not be dispensed, as it is very tasty.",1,1,1,1,rafael
"The tapiocas are very good and the atmosphere is very pleasant, although small. The decoration resembles the nordestino and has themed hats for those who want to take a photo.

"I went to this restaurant three times during my stay in Maceiu00f3. The first time was at the beachfront unit, more sophisticated, with dishes identical to the other, but more expensive. The food was not the best, but it was reasonably good. I ordered a cod and my husband, prawns with potatoes au gratin. Our second experience was at the unit on the beach promenade. Out of curiosity, we ordered a mini Shrimp Gum. Honestly, I was amazed that this was the flagship of the restaurant. Even though it is a small portion, my husband, my daughter and I cannot eat everything. Extremely strong and greasy! The last time, to close with a flourish, we went to dinner in this unit of the boardwalk. I ordered a spaghetti with fillet in a sugo sauce, unmatchable ... raw pasta and the tomato sauce looked like lemon, it was so acidic! My husband's dish, ditto! Raw rice, raw vegetables and lots of fat. The fish, although tasty, was very small.",0,1,1,1,rafael

"I was at the pizzeria recently, I ordered the flavors I always ask for; arugula with parma and chicken with curd. When the pizza arrived I was disappointed because I was used to the quality and care of the pizzeria. The parma pizza did not arrive as usual, before I ordered and arrived at the table with plenty of parma, living up to the flavor, the last time I ordered, pieces of parma came and in addition they did not share the flavors equally, adding more pizza chicken. If it is to save parma, it would be more efficient to get it off the menu soon. The pizza was even aesthetically poor, not consistent with the amount of almost 70 reais that is charged, a value that I did not think was unfair for the quality, but that now does not match. As for chicken, they substituted smoked chicken (which was much tastier) with regular chicken. The pizza was not bad, but I was used to it much more beautiful and tasty. I will return with less expectations and with the hope that I went on a bad day. The service and the environment are still very good.",1,-1,1,1,rafael
