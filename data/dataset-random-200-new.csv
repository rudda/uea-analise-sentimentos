"The buffet has many options, but nothing is tasty. The decor is modern, the service is reasonable and the price is good, if you buy a coupon on collective shopping sites.",1,1
"The restaurant has a wide variety of dishes, the staff are attentive and friendly. Pleasant and familiar atmosphere. All dishes are good and delicious, they are always making replacement. I highly recommend it.",1,1
"I was extremely poorly attended by the meter trainee. I complained about my plate, the meat came spoiled, it stank so much that the table next to it felt and asked if it was fish. The restaurant limited itself to saying that it was in the standard and that it was cut Thursday, they did not reverse or replace the dish. The cook was summoned, acknowledged the mistake, apologized and even so the Trainee, who should not be representing the company, refused to take any action and kept looking with a mocking face.",0,-1
First-rate reception. Large and air-conditioned place. Stay upstairs with a view of the bald hill. First world service. We ordered the international prawns with five star quality.,0,1
"Happy New Year with friends from long dates ... We went there, because one of the friends was withthe daughter and needed a playground environment for the daughter to destroy herself, the general was very good!",1,1
"Frutaria Su00e3o Paulo is known in the Moema neighborhood for its fresh, natural and light food. The choice of salads, natural sandwiches and fruit juices is huge. The place is very pleasant with a very charming exterior.",1,1

"I always go to this restaurant, and I recommend it, it has a great variety and the meat is wonderful, I always come with friends and I do not exchange for anything my favorite restaurant, not to mention the service that is first world. Adorooo!",1,1
"Very good restaurant! Several options for all tastes, many options of salads and meats.Their service system is different, it is not self-service. You must choose your options of salad and side dishes, meat and dessert if desired. I suggest knowing the system beforehand and choosing your dish before taking the queue.",0,1
The best Christmas chop. I went with some friends there and had a lot of fun. Very pleasant atmosphere. The cost benefit is very good.,1,1
Amazing experience! Wonderful tasting menu and fresh and fun presentation! Worth all the success!Felipe-carioca was super friendly and efficient,1,1

Shorty you are 10 !! There was only sunshine and good foodShorty you are 10 !! There was only sunshine and good foodShorty you are 10 !! There was only sunshine and good food,1,1
"Very good for meeting friends. There are options for vegan friends and a truck with several good beers (I don't remember the name but it was an ambulance hahaah). Outside, the owners could take their pets there <3",0,1
"Easy location. Ok atmosphere, nothing extraordinary, but ok.But when you look at the menu, it gives a little shiver, even though it doesn't have Italian origins. Picanha Pizza, file with fries, stroganoff, etc ...Can you really assess the quality of the pasta (texture, thickness, etc.), the tomato sauce (fresh, acidity, aroma) or even a restaurant that has it on the menu? We tried.Let's go to basicu00e3o, there will be no pepperoni error + muzarela.When the disc of what they call pizza arrived, what they call pasta was raw and on top it had filling for about 3 pizzas.Anyway, the best definition would be the following: ogre pizza.I won't be back, not recommended. But it has taste and taste for everything, right? Even for stroganoff pizza ...",0,1
"Bright environment, beautiful architecture, good service, delicious food, several sweets accompany the coffee, very delicate in the details, I would definitely return!",1,1
"Julianderson (waiter) very polite, friendly, helped us in choosing the varied menu.Moises and Ivanir completed the team.Great service.Grade 10 for the team.",0,1

"I really loved the place, especially the juices that are delicious and also the vitamins worth visiting the place",1,1

"Restaurant with delicious homemade food, very well prepared, I really loved it and recommend it to everyone.",1,1
"I had already visited the restaurant several times and unfortunately when I returned after a long time I had a surprise that was not the best. The food itself continues as it always has been, generous dishes, well seasoned in the best American style (although more expensive than the competitor) still worth not having the same rows. However, for the first time, I was served in an unusual way, the dishes took a long time to be served, the attendants seemed scattered and the sound was very loud. I believe it was a time of mistakes that will not be repeated.",0,1
"Perfect!!! The meals we had there were fantastic !! Great service, great seasoning !!! It was amazing!!!",1,1
"Nice food. fair price, stylish ambience, friendly waiters, clean bathroom, wonderful view, well worth a visit.",1,1
"Attentive waiters and excellent service. Nice atmosphere and good food. I would go back other times for sure. I recommend, very good for groups",1,1
"The only good points are that the place is beautiful and the food is good. However, the service is very slow, several times we need to ask the security to call someone to assist us, since the house was not even full. In addition, we were only informed about the cover charge for DJ at the cash register, since the entry only contained the amount for the band. Anyway, it left a lot to be desired, I do not recommend it.",1,1
Purpose is good. The price is good. The variety is good. But the service is terrible and the replacement is very slow. As it is for kilo it takes to be able to finish the dish waiting for the meal. Not worth it,1,1
Great option to eat Japanese food per kg! You eat very well without paying too much! Quality Japanese food and even has several types of sweet sushi!,0,1
"worth checking out, a great place to have fun, as well as being on one of the most popular beaches in Fortaleza",0,1
"Excellent service and quality products! Far beyond a simple hamburger, they also serve various types of cuts, several beer options and served extremely cold! Super cozy atmosphereIt is super worth the visit!",1,1
"The place is very cozy, good music, cold beer, tasty pastries and affordable prices. The only problem is that at midnight they hand over the bills for all the tables and close the place.",1,-1
"Salad bar very good, but the meats are the highlight. Always at the right spot, they arrive hot at the table, very well served by waiters specialized in the subject.The service is excellent and the atmosphere is very pleasant due to the large windows that allow more external light.",1,1
Restaurant with great service and wonderful meat! The waiter Valmir welcomed us very well! I recommend!,1,1
"I bought 03 ice creams and after consuming they came to claim internal rules of charging 1.00 more for each one when paying by credit or debit card. They say they can do that because it is in the law. But the law does not speak of values u200bu200bor forms of payment !!! They refused to understand the law. It was a total inconvenience. They are assaulting customers !!! Cashier Sassu00e1, says his name is Julielson, he refused to call the owner, says he is called Gleidson, to solve the problem and even made fun of the case !!! In short, terrible location. An assault on customers on their rights.In the images are the official law and their law in the pen, fixed in hidden places in the bakery.DO NOT BUY, DO NOT GO THERE. AVOID PASSING DISORDER.I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO MY ENEMY.",0,1
"At least once a year we usually go to the restaurant but this time we are disappointed with the food. My duck rice was a bit greasy and my husband's ribs dish tasteless, but the worst was the entrance of manioc dumplings that were horrible. They should excel in taste and not in glamor. Atendimentp remains impeccable.",1,-1
I had the opportunity to have lunch with families for a business meeting. The atmosphere is very pleasant and the taste of the food and the quality of what is served is wonderful.,1,1
"I went with a large group on a Saturday night for drinks and dinner. When bringing the drinks (which cost an exorbitant R $ 40.00 each) the waiter did the feat of dropping three of the four glasses on the tray literally on top of my wife. His reaction was to stand still while the tray finished dripping on top of him, then murmur some kind of inaudible excuse and just disappear.He never came back, despite the fact that, already irritated by the rudeness, we had specifically asked the Night Manager, by the way the only polite and attentive person in the place, if he did not intend to apologize.It wasn't just that. You ask for water and the other waiter, who did not know who had asked, stops at the corner of a table of 8 people and starts shouting: - Water, Water !!!To complete, the breaded steak is massive and the entrecote we send back, with so much fat in the meat. The filet mignon tartare is worth it.",0,1
"The atmosphere is very pleasant and the service is attentive. At the beginning we ordered the couvert (excellent baguette with a pepper butter and honey) and the pork croquette which was very tasty. As a main dish a Lamb rice that was excellent! For dessert, a tasteless creme brulee that left something to be desired, was the weak point! The Fondant cake was delicious. Worth the visit.",1,1
"Excellent service, the place is very relaxed. The food was delicious, the best of all was the starter of manioc cake with shrimp.",1,1
"The stall of the lu00f4ro is super traditional in Salvador. It is on Flamengo beach, away from the most touristic neighborhoods like Ondina and Rio Vermelho, so if you are a tourist and use a taxi to go, prepare your pocket. The place is cool and lively. The menu has a good variety, and the price is okay.",1,1
"I really liked the place, but I consider the prices of the dishes expensive. It is good for those who have a larger budget to enjoy. For those looking for less sophistication and more practicality and more affordable price, I don't consider it a good place. Just to go once to really know.",0,1
"Be sure to order the portion of cod cakes (perfect) and it also comes with a very good pepper sauce. For main course: lagareido cod (noble part of the fish served with potatoes, boiled eggs and olives). Great options of Port wines. For dessert, ice cream sundae.",1,1
"We have been customers of the house for some time, we know most of the waiters, and I can say with propriety that it is the best service currently in this city. Willian's service, always friendly and objective. Congratulations to the managers.",0,1
"This restaurant follows the standard of Good and Cheap. Delicious food, I didn't even have to look for a place outside the event that was at the Convention Center, throughout the event we ate at it. You can rest assured that the food is good.",0,1
"Great service and a varied menu. Great for a happy hour with friends. It also has several options for breakfast. I already had lunch at the buffet but it didn't impress, but it also left something to be desired.",1,1
"The carvery belt stopped working as soon as I arrived, there were few waiters and it was passed on to people who could order anything from the menu. We spent 20 minutes waiting to be served and another 40 waiting to get what we asked for. The order arrived wrong and there was no one to answer us. We decided to leave and go to another place, they charged us the carvery in full, even though we saw that we didn't consume anything, nor did the drinks reach the table. The local employee said they had fewer employees, apologized, but we still paid the full rotation, which is a very expensive price for not eating anything.",0,-1
excellent restaurant. Top quality Japanese food and impeccable service. It gets quite crowded after 9pm. Pleasant and romantic atmosphere. Suitable for lovers and also for dinner with friends.,1,1
"It was surprising to me, because I went to Hachiko for lunch and didn't know about the contemporary Japanese cuisine. I liked most of the dishes a lot, I think the ideas worked in many, but not all. It's fun and interesting. But avoid rush hours, because the queue at the door is huge.",0,1
"The last time I came here, two years ago, it gave me a very good nostalgia from the Nikkei era, fresh food, typical Japanese dishes ... but yesterday I came back and found it very good. Too bad, the fish were dry, it was not at all proud. It was so bad, I didn't even eat the extra portion of wild salmon, which they ended up kindly not charging. I ordered jasmine tea and it was bag tea, what a pity. I'll give it a little more time before I give up for good.",0,1
"We had already been to the restaurant on 2 occasions, but this time we took my parents who reside in Portugal. The service provided by Van Damme was sensational. From the moment of choosing the table until the end of the dinner.It's great to see professionals who show their appreciation and talent for the work they do. I believe that there is nothing more fair than the recognition of the work performed by the waiter, as well as the quality of the meat served by the restaurant.The spicy meat empanadas are delicious and the ant sausage stuffed with provolone surprised.We chose Prime Rib and T-Bone as meats, both were delicious, but we left a highlight for Prime Rib, very marbled and soft.Congratulations to the establishment for having a guy like Van Damme in his professional body and for the quality of what he has on his menu.",1,1
"Good and cheap. I wasn't expecting much, but I was surprised by the quality and the price! Very attentive and fast service!",1,1
"We stayed at the celi hotel, on the edge of Atalaia, which is very close to the Pitu com Piru00e3o restaurant. We went to dinner at this restaurant and were very well attended by waiters Jeferson and Buiu. We ordered a grilled sea bass with vegetables, rice and pitu piru00e3o. It was wonderful. Not to mention great quality wines and cold beer. In addition, the owner of the house (Pedro) brought us an explored olive oil for us to try and season the food. Dear very good people. The price is right for the excellent level of the food offered. So we ended up returning the next day to have lunch at Pitu with Piru00e3o. It's really worth it. Be sure to go to this restaurant when you go to Aracaju. It's top.",1,1
The restaurant is really bad. Cold dish without seasoningA bad experience that I would not recommend to anyone. Service also very poor. Have a beer and go. Don't throw money away.,1,-1
"Restaurant with great quality and variety in Rodu00edzio. Includes Robatas and everything else you are entitled to. Family atmosphere and good service. Go on less busy days, during the week at night, as you will be able to enjoy the rotation better and you will certainly have a good service.",1,1

"I love the salad buffet for being very complete, it makes all the difference for lovers of healthy dishes who don't want to eat just pizza. The pizzas are very varied and have some very exotic. Best pizza in Poa.",1,1
"I had a frustration. We wanted to know this restaurant for a long time.The service is excellent, great atmosphere.The disappointment was the steaks. The picanha, for example, you felt because it was not fresh. The normal rib. Tasteless sheep.Great salads, but the meat that is the flagship of the house did not please.",1,1
"We love to visit the Farofa du2019agua restaurant, a nice place and attentive staff! Plentiful and delicious food, I recommend everyone to know!",1,1
"Simply wonderful food and service! The price is not that cheap (100 reais a carvery) but it is worth every penny!In addition to the meats, it has a cold and a seafood track! It even had lobster! Super attentive waiters! I recommend !",1,1
"In Maceio we prioritize eating fish and shrimp because they are the local specialties, but almost by chance we ended up going in and eating a pizza, which owes nothing to the best of Su00e3o Paulo we are used to.Beautiful environment, good service and live music, location close to Ponta Verde beach.I recommend !",0,1
It has the best rib in Brazil ... it is famous for this dish ... the other meats are always well served and succulent ... however if you want to eat rib no other place is better..it is close to the biggest mall in Campo Grande. .,1,1
"Mc Donald's standard, nothing new, service and product offered at any other establishment in the chain. Good location in the Rio Vermelho neighborhood, close to the Bompreu00e7o Supermarket, fast service.",0,1
"A group of women decided to celebrate the birthday and with permission from the place, they brought the singer u2019u2019 with a speaker and everything. Summary: no one listens, hellish music, out of tune. I will not be returning.",0,0
"We were at the Emperor located on Pajuu00e7ara beach. Nice atmosphere, good live music but poor service. We had to call the maitre d 'twice to be attended. Tasty dishes, but they were cold. To pay, we had to get up and pay directly at the cashier, as no one came to answer. Anyway, a super recommended that disappointed!",1,-1
"Good option for:Who heard and is curious to know.Who is an admirer of the owner, Olivier Anquier.He has children and teenagers, who enjoy eating potato chips without limits.Who doesn't mind having only one option on the menu (always).Professional and exceptionally kind service.Nice place.During the week, attended by young executives at lunch.",1,1
"Excellent steakhouse with varieties. Good service, Excellent food, with a choice of Japanese food. Well located. Good security and close to the Hotel,",1,1
Food very well done and very good service !!I recommend everyone who comes to the center to come and meet !!,0,1
"The quality of everything that is served is very good. The issue is service and care. We are here at the moment and it looks incredible, but we spent at least 10 minutes waiting for someone to stop by our table to serve some meat. And look, we're at a steakhouse! !! At that point you have to improve a lot. The highlight is the quality of the meat. And in this regard, perhaps the steakhouse deserves a second chance. As for the cordiality of the staff, I am with colleagues here on the trip, it is lucky, some of them serve well others do not care! !!!",1,1
"9 cozy environment, safe space for children to play. Good food and helpful serviceGood parking, as it is located in a mallI hope to come back more often",0,1
"The disadvantage of the place is its location, as it is not so privileged in the city, but it is close to the access to BR, so for those who are passing by the access point (traveling), it is worth a stop.",0,1
"Cozy atmosphere, wonderful food, waiter Roberval is a figure, live music of a high level and super nice.",1,1
"Several hamburger options, but delicious. I have already tasted salmon, chicken, chicken heart, bacon and meat. I've tasted the meat passport too. I liked almost everyone, more than the salmon. I hated the bacon, very sick and look that I love bacon.",1,-1
"Excellent restaurant with many options on the menu. Delicious and relaxed atmosphere with very attentive staff, especially the waiter Claudio, who served us very well!Great program in Fortaleza.",1,1
"the restaurant Du Chef Arte and a place for those who want to eat a different dish, that is, a finger-licking meal with its culinary magic",1,1
"Located in a very quiet neighborhood in BH, the pizzeria is worth the visit. Yummy and cozy atmosphere.We went on a Saturday night and were lucky to find a first-class table, but it looks like it is pretty full.The service was good, but nothing spectacular. The pizza was very tasty and tasty.On the menu, there is a diversity of beers and a good wine list. The price is standard, neither too expensive nor too cheap.I liked it, recommend it and would go back.",1,1
"The Greek restaurant is a great restaurant if you want to eat with the family, but it is very crowded, you will probably take a huge line, but it won't take long. The food is super varied and tasty, ranging from Italian food to fish, the most diverse salads, meat of all kinds, in short, very good! It is worth it for those who want to eat well and spend a little, as the price is a little salty at weekends.",0,1
"Very nice place, airy and with very well prepared waiters !! Varied menu, of course the focus is on shrimp, but if you don't eat there are meat options too !! Fair price because it is within the range of good restaurants !!! Average price of double plate of R $ 100.00.",1,1
"Delicious! But you have to know how to make pasta, not to spoil it. Are beautiful!!!! The desire to eat them all!",1,1
"Excellent location, a really cozy place to go with friends to enjoy a sound and the wind from the shore.",1,1
"Whatever type of typical dish you find there! Great flavor, pleasant atmosphere, excellent service !!!! Impossible not to leave with several extra pounds !!! But it pays off, especially for those who do not know much about Northeastern cuisine, it is good, as you can taste everything a little, because it is sef service! I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city, which by the way is beautiful!",1,1
"Was it against sense? Unfortunately not. You can see another evaluation of mine about the same restaurant, which I have known for over 6 years, about its excellent food and service. Today, July 6, I had the worst experience with the place. EVERYTHING TO BE CRITICIZED: dirty table, lack of attention and courtesy, tasteless food, expensive price, due to the poor quality of the food (I didnu2019t eat worse meat), terrible service, lack of interest from the waiters to the manager, in short, nothing was worth it . I left the house with the best expectation of returning to one of my favorite restaurants in Natal and I don't know when I'll be back again. I had planned to visit the Brasilia unit. I'll rethink.",1,-1
Pleasant place with several environments that suit all musical tastes. On the day of my visit a live show was taking place with the singer Caubi Peixoto. The snacks are also very good.,0,1

"A great choice for sandwiches, to please all types of taste. Good service and great location",1,1
"I really liked the restaurant, because the service was very good and the view was wonderful, you could see Praia do Forte from there. The dishes are also affordable, as they are very hearty and probably a portion for 2 people will serve 3 people quietly. The food was also very tasty and the juice was excellent. I highly recommend it, as the value for money is great for the quality of food they offer!",1,1
"Just don't come to the mall just to come here. Sunday family lunch. Children, full house, slower service, complete package. The food, which is of interest, is no big deal. In Brasilia, I still prefer the city's classic and competitor: El Paso Texas.",0,1
"The draft beer is cold, the service is excellent, the feijoada dumpling is one of the best I've ever had in a bar. In addition to well frequented and well located.",1,1
"whenever I go to SP I have a meal in this genuinely Italian restaurant, the mandatory choice is the pepperoni and polpetone, but the pasta is also very good and the filet a generous portion of Parmigiana. only negative point for me is not having 600ml beer. the price is good, between R $ 70.00 and R $ 90.00 per person on average.",1,1
"I was with my family at Coco Bambu near Beira Mar in Fortaleza and ordered a dish that always like in Su00e3o Paulo and without exception always comes out wonderful. But on this visit the Beira Mar branch was very disappointed with the dish. First the quantity of Cameroon was extremely reduced, and with that what came was potato straw and rice that was dry. I complained to the waiter who agreed with the criticism, and told me that the Maitre d 'would come to the table, which I am waiting for so far. Summary, lousy dish and no attitude from the house staff. Unfortunate. The bill was over R $ 270.00.",1,-1
"Spettus' food is amazing. A wonderful carvery, accompanied by a 10-note buffet.",1,1
"He went to the manekineko (home shopping) with my wife and once again we were treated exceptionally.

The products are too good, the beer is always cold, the food is delicious and in large quantities. The service leaves a little to be desired, but because the space is always full. Beautiful people abound.",1,1

"The restaurant has a very pleasant atmosphere. The service was first rate. The food was very tasty. Finally, the price did not scare. It is recommended.",1,1
"The lunch buffet during the week is excellent. The quality of the food is surprising, to be served by the kilo. The pudding is from the gods, you can order without fear. The kids space has a curious size restriction, it only accepts children up to 4 years old.",1,1
"Great snacks and optical draft beer. We ate the portion of pancetta, portion of pastries and chicken. Everything was delicious, an honest pub food, very well done. It is not a very cheap place, but it was worth the visit. We will be back for sure.",1,1
"Great salty pizzas, the sweets leave something to be desired, some seem semi raw and the service is terrible. The 3 times I went I waited a long time for pizza.",1,-1

Restaurant with excellent seafood and a huge variety on the menu. There are pizzas and crepes that are also delicious and the caipirosca is top.,1,1
Another unit of excellence of the coco bamboo chain. The extensive menu with many options pleases most people and all dishes are really well served.,0,1
"This restaurant also has a unit located within the Rio Branco airport. At this location, lunch is a self-service type with lots of meat and other dishes. The place is air conditioned and very quiet so you can have a meal before or after traveling.",0,-1
Quality of fish and variety of dishes .... Easy access and excellent menu. I recommend the visit.,1,1
"I went into this restaurant a few years ago and I noticed a sharp drop in the overall quality of the dishes. The chickpea and eggplant pastes were very bad, the bread seemed industrialized, without softness and old. The hot dishes seemed too Brazilian, losing much of their originality and why not say flavor. Despite the good service it was a bad experience and I have no reason to return to this restaurant. The difference in quality of this restaurant, in terms of food, for the 2 other competitors in the city is striking and even so there was a good movement. It seems that the gaucho public is getting less demanding.",0,1
A really nice space. It is excellent for those who just want to enjoy a night having a beer and talking with friends. The music is of great quality and so is the food.,1,1
"Nice place that has a very good pasta carvery! The price is quite attractive, that is, it is an excellent cost-benefit ratio.",1,1
"Nilo Peu00e7anha's health was better and cleaner. I ordered a natural chicken sandwich and came a pile of leaves with shredded chicken and an indecipherable yellow sauce, tasteless and falling apart. I don't think they ever cleaned glass or did maintenance on the deck, left. Feather.",1,-1
"I am demanding in terms of quality and service in restaurants. I can say that Osteria Mattiazzi is impeccable. The details that make a dinner a truly unforgettable experience, in every way. From the meticulous service to the presentation and balance of the dishes, including an excellent wine list. The owner is Italian and a deep connoisseur of native cuisine, as well as an enthusiastic lover of wines from Italy and elsewhere. I recommend it with all the emphasis and joy.",1,1
"The place is charming, cool and you really feel you belong to the capital of Su00e3o Paulo here. Both the drinks and the dishes are incredibly delicious and I don't imagine that anything can take away the feeling of a great experience on site. Even on rainy days like the one I went to, it is possible to admire the beautiful view that the roof of the famous Hotel Unique provides, to delight with the crab cone and the most different types of food specialties gathered in one place.

From the beginning, attentive and concerned with serving us properly, guiding us to ask for what is necessary. A family that was close to us caught my attention, very indecisive and at no time did he lose his patience or attention. Instead.
